"Storage Almost Full."

You've seen this notification. You've ignored this notification. You've promised yourself you'll deal with it later.

Later never comes.

So you delete some apps. Buy more iCloud storage. Keep kicking the can.

Here's the truth: you don't have a storage problem. You have a garbage problem.

## The photo library mess

Open your photo library. Scroll through.

- 47 nearly identical shots of the same thing (you were trying to get "the perfect one")
- Screenshots of things you've already dealt with
- Blurry photos you'll never look at
- Duplicates from backups and transfers
- Random images saved from the internet

You're not keeping 10,000 memories. You're keeping 3,000 memories and 7,000 pieces of digital clutter.

## Why you don't clean up

Manual cleanup is soul-destroying.

Scroll through thousands of photos. Evaluate each one. Delete. Confirm delete. Repeat.

Nobody has time for this. So nobody does it. The garbage accumulates.

## What if AI could find the junk?

Modern AI can identify:
- **Blurry photos** — images that aren't sharp enough to keep
- **Duplicates** — nearly identical shots you don't need 47 of
- **Screenshots** — that shipping confirmation from 2022
- **Low-quality images** — dark, overexposed, or poorly composed shots

It takes minutes. Not hours.

## Why I built Shotkeeper

[Shotkeeper](/apps/shotkeeper) is your photo library cleanup crew:

- **AI duplicate detection** — finds similar photos, groups them, keeps the best
- **Blurry photo finder** — identifies shots that aren't worth keeping
- **Screenshot organizer** — separates screenshots from real photos
- **Storage savings calculator** — see how much space you'll free up

Review AI suggestions. Delete with confidence. Reclaim gigabytes.

No more "Storage Almost Full."

No more scrolling through garbage looking for memories.

Your photos should spark joy. Not dread.
