Every calorie guide starts with "calculate your TDEE."

But what is TDEE? How do you calculate it? And why does it matter?

Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is TDEE?

**TDEE = Total Daily Energy Expenditure**

It's the total number of calories you burn in a day.

Not just exercise. Everything:
- Breathing
- Thinking
- Walking
- Digesting
- Existing

If you eat exactly your TDEE, your weight stays the same.

## The Components of TDEE

### 1. BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) — 60-70%
Calories burned just existing. If you lay in bed all day, this is what you'd burn.

Includes: heart beating, lungs breathing, brain thinking, cells regenerating.

### 2. TEF (Thermic Effect of Food) — 10%
Calories burned digesting food.

Protein = highest TEF (~25%)
Carbs = medium (~10%)
Fat = lowest (~3%)

### 3. NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) — 15-20%
Calories burned through daily movement that isn't exercise.

Walking, fidgeting, standing, typing.

This varies HUGELY between people.

### 4. EAT (Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) — 5-10%
Calories burned through intentional exercise.

Surprisingly small percentage for most people.

## How to Calculate TDEE

### Step 1: Calculate BMR

**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (most accurate):**

Men: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5

Women: BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161

### Step 2: Apply Activity Multiplier

Multiply BMR by activity factor:

| Activity Level | Multiplier | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Sedentary | 1.2 | Desk job, no exercise |
| Light | 1.375 | Light exercise 1-3 days/week |
| Moderate | 1.55 | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week |
| Active | 1.725 | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week |
| Very Active | 1.9 | Athlete, physical job + exercise |

**TDEE = BMR × Activity Multiplier**

### Example Calculation

30-year-old woman
Height: 165 cm
Weight: 65 kg
Moderate exercise

**BMR:** (10 × 65) + (6.25 × 165) - (5 × 30) - 161
= 650 + 1031 - 150 - 161
= 1,370 calories

**TDEE:** 1,370 × 1.55 = 2,124 calories/day

## Using TDEE for Your Goals

### Weight Loss
**Eat below TDEE**

Standard deficit: TDEE - 500 calories = ~1 lb lost per week
Aggressive deficit: TDEE - 750-1000 calories = faster but harder

Example: TDEE of 2,124 → Eat 1,624 for weight loss

### Muscle Gain
**Eat above TDEE**

Lean bulk: TDEE + 200-300 calories
Standard bulk: TDEE + 500 calories

Example: TDEE of 2,124 → Eat 2,400-2,600 for muscle gain

### Maintenance
**Eat at TDEE**

Weight stays stable. Good after reaching goal weight.

## Why TDEE Calculators Are Just Estimates

Important caveat: All TDEE calculations are estimates.

**They don't account for:**
- Your specific metabolism
- Genetic differences
- Hormonal factors
- NEAT variation (huge between individuals)
- Daily variation

**How to refine:**
1. Calculate estimated TDEE
2. Eat that amount for 2 weeks
3. Track weight
4. Adjust based on results

Weight stable? TDEE is accurate.
Gaining weight? TDEE is lower than calculated.
Losing weight? TDEE is higher than calculated.

## Common TDEE Mistakes

### 1. Overestimating activity level
Most people choose "moderate" or "active."

Most people are actually "sedentary" or "light."

Be honest. A desk job + 3 gym sessions = Light Activity.

### 2. Not adjusting over time
TDEE changes as:
- Weight changes
- Age increases
- Activity changes
- Metabolism adapts

Recalculate every 10-15 lbs lost or every few months.

### 3. Expecting exact results
Your body isn't a calculator. Water weight, hormones, and daily variation exist.

Look at trends over weeks, not daily fluctuations.

### 4. Using online calculators blindly
Every calculator gives different results.

Use them as starting points, then adjust.

## Quick TDEE Estimation

Don't want to do math?

**Rough estimate:**
- Sedentary: Weight (lbs) × 12-13
- Light activity: Weight (lbs) × 13-14
- Moderate activity: Weight (lbs) × 14-15
- Active: Weight (lbs) × 15-16

150 lbs, moderate activity: 150 × 14.5 = 2,175 calories

## Using CalorieCalculator

[CalorieCalculator](/apps/caloriecalculator) does the math for you:

1. Enter your stats
2. Select activity level
3. Choose your goal
4. Get your calorie target

Plus macro recommendations based on your goal.

## FAQ

**What's the difference between BMR and TDEE?**
BMR is calories burned at rest. TDEE is BMR plus all activity.

**Why is my TDEE so high/low?**
Height, weight, age, and activity level all factor in. Very tall/heavy people have higher TDEE.

**Does muscle increase TDEE?**
Yes, but modestly. 1 lb of muscle burns ~6 extra calories per day. Don't overestimate this.

**How often should I recalculate TDEE?**
Every 10-15 lbs of weight change, or every 2-3 months.

**Is 1200 calories ever appropriate?**
Rarely. For most adults, eating below BMR is dangerous and unsustainable. Consult a professional.

**Why am I not losing weight at a deficit?**
Common reasons: tracking inaccuracy, TDEE overestimation, water retention, metabolic adaptation. Review your numbers.
