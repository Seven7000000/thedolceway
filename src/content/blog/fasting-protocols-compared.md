"What fasting schedule should I do?"

I get this question constantly.

Here's the truth: The best protocol is the one you'll actually stick to.

But that's not helpful. So let me break down the popular options and tell you who they're actually for.

## The Protocols, Explained

### 16:8 — The Starter

**Fast 16 hours. Eat within 8 hours.**

Example: Skip breakfast. Eat from 12pm to 8pm.

**Who it's for:**
- Complete beginners
- People with social eating habits
- Anyone who wants to dip their toes in

**Reality check:** You're basically just skipping breakfast. Most people do this accidentally on busy days. It works, but the benefits are modest.

### 18:6 — The Sweet Spot

**Fast 18 hours. Eat within 6 hours.**

Example: First meal at 1pm. Last meal by 7pm.

**Who it's for:**
- People who've done 16:8 and want more
- Those who want deeper ketosis benefits
- Anyone comfortable skipping breakfast AND eating dinner earlier

**Reality check:** This is where most people land long-term. Noticeable benefits. Still social-life compatible.

### 20:4 — The Warrior

**Fast 20 hours. Eat within 4 hours.**

Example: Eat from 4pm to 8pm only.

**Who it's for:**
- Experienced fasters
- People who don't mind eating one big meal and one snack
- Those who want maximum fat-burning time

**Reality check:** Gets difficult to eat enough calories. Not great for people trying to build muscle. Social eating becomes tricky.

### OMAD — One Meal A Day

**Fast 23+ hours. One meal.**

Example: Dinner only. Every day.

**Who it's for:**
- People who hate thinking about food
- Those who want maximum simplicity
- Experienced fasters ready for intensity

**Reality check:** Hard to get proper nutrition. Can lead to overeating. Works for some, dangerous for others.

## The Comparison

| Protocol | Best For | Difficulty | Fat Burning | Social Life |
|----------|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 16:8 | Beginners | Easy | Moderate | Great |
| 18:6 | Most people | Medium | Good | Good |
| 20:4 | Experienced | Hard | Excellent | Okay |
| OMAD | Minimalists | Very Hard | Maximum | Difficult |

## My Recommendation

**Week 1-2:** Start with 16:8. Get used to morning hunger.

**Week 3-4:** Try 18:6 a few days. See how it feels.

**Week 5+:** Find your rhythm. Maybe it's 16:8 on social days, 18:6 on regular days.

There's no rule that says you have to pick one and stick to it forever.

## The Mistakes People Make

**Starting too aggressive:**
Going straight to OMAD is like running a marathon on day one. Start easy. Build up.

**Being too rigid:**
If brunch exists on Sunday, eat brunch. One flexible day won't ruin anything.

**Ignoring hunger signals:**
Fasting should feel sustainable. If you're constantly miserable, you're doing it wrong.

**Obsessing over exact times:**
You ate at 12:17 instead of 12:00. You're fine. The principle matters, not the precision.

## Pick One and Start

Analysis paralysis kills more fasts than hunger does.

Pick 16:8. Try it for two weeks. Adjust from there.
