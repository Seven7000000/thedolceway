That 3pm slump? Probably dehydration.

That headache? Dehydration.

That mid-morning hunger? Also dehydration.

You drink water. But probably not enough. And definitely not consistently.

Let's fix that.

## How Much Water Do You Actually Need?

The "8 glasses a day" thing? Made up. No scientific basis.

A better formula:

**Your body weight (lbs) ÷ 2 = ounces of water per day**

So if you weigh 160 lbs, aim for 80 oz (about 2.4 liters).

Adjust up for:
- Exercise
- Hot weather
- Coffee/alcohol consumption
- High protein diets

## Signs You're Dehydrated Right Now

**Obvious ones:**
- Dark yellow urine
- Dry mouth
- Thirst

**Less obvious ones:**
- Afternoon fatigue
- Headaches
- Difficulty concentrating
- Hunger between meals
- Bad breath
- Dry skin

Here's the kicker: by the time you feel thirsty, you're already dehydrated.

## Why You're Always Behind

### Coffee counts against you
Coffee is a diuretic. It makes you pee more. That morning coffee doesn't hydrate you — it dehydrates you.

For every cup of coffee, drink an extra glass of water to break even.

### You drink in bursts, not consistently
Chugging a liter at dinner doesn't make up for 8 hours of nothing. Your body can only absorb so much at once. The rest just... leaves.

### You've normalized dehydration
When you're chronically underhydrated, your body stops sending strong thirst signals. You feel "fine" but you're actually running at 70%.

### Water is boring
Let's be honest. Soda, coffee, juice — they all taste better. Water requires discipline.

## The Fix

### 1. Front-load your morning
Drink 16-20oz as soon as you wake up. Before coffee. Before anything.

You've just gone 8 hours without water. Your body needs it.

### 2. Set dumb simple reminders
Not "drink 8 glasses." Just "drink something every 2 hours."

Small, consistent doses beat big irregular chugging.

### 3. Keep water visible
Bottle on desk. Glass by the couch. Water in every room you spend time in.

Out of sight = out of mind.

### 4. Track it (at least for a week)
You think you drink enough. You probably don't.

Track it. See the actual number. Get the reality check.

### 5. Eat your water
Cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, lettuce — these are 90%+ water.

Hydration doesn't only come from drinking.

## The Habit Stack

Here's what works:

- **Wake up:** 16oz water immediately
- **Before each meal:** 8oz water
- **Every 2 hours:** 8oz water
- **Before bed:** 8oz water

That's 80+ oz without thinking hard. Adjust based on your needs.

## Track Without Thinking

[WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) makes this stupid simple.

One tap to log. Gentle reminders that aren't annoying. Progress you can see at a glance.

No gamification. No badges. No leaderboards.

Just water tracking that actually works.
