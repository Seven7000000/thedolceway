Headspace and Calm dominate the meditation app market.

Both cost $70/year. Both have millions of users. Both promise to transform your life.

Which is better? And do you even need to pay?

## Headspace vs Calm: Quick Overview

## Headspace: Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths:

- **Educational approach** — Teaches you WHY meditation works
- **Animations** — Cute explainers that make concepts stick
- **Andy Puddicombe** — Consistent, calming voice throughout
- **Move Mode** — Guided exercise and movement

### Weaknesses:
- **One main voice** — If you don't like Andy, limited options
- **Less sleep content** — Calm has better sleep stories
- **Can feel repetitive** — Animation style throughout
- **Structured can feel limiting** — Less freedom to explore

### Best for:

- Users who prefer one consistent guide

## Calm: Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths:
- **Sleep stories** — Celebrity narrated (Matthew McConaughey, Harry Styles)
- **More variety** — Multiple teachers and styles
- **Relaxation focus** — Great for stress relief
- **Nature scenes** — Beautiful visual ambiance
- **Daily Calm** — New content every day

### Weaknesses:
- **Less structured** — Can feel overwhelming
- **Less educational** — More "do" less "understand"
- **Premium feels essential** — Free tier is very limited
- **Sleep focus** — Meditation content less robust than Headspace

### Best for:

- Users who prefer exploring over structured courses
- Anyone who wants relaxation more than education

## Head-to-Head Comparison

### For beginners:
**Winner: Headspace**
The structured courses teach meditation properly. Calm assumes you know what you're doing.

### For sleep:
**Winner: Calm**
Sleep stories are genuinely excellent. Celebrity narration adds something.

### For anxiety:
**Winner: Tie**
Both have good anxiety content. Headspace is more educational, Calm more soothing.

### For value:
**Winner: Neither**
$70/year for meditation guidance is expensive when free alternatives exist.

### For interface:
**Winner: Calm**
Headspace is good, but Calm is beautiful.

## The Honest Recommendation

**Try this first:**
1. Download [MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp) — free, no subscription pressure

Different, not better. Headspace for education and structure. Calm for relaxation and sleep.

Calm, clearly. The sleep stories are their killer feature.
