How many ideas have you lost?

Not forgotten. Lost. Gone before you could capture them.

In the shower. While driving. Mid-conversation. On a walk.

You told yourself you'd remember. You didn't.

## The Problem

Your brain generates its best ideas when you're NOT trying to have ideas.

That's called diffuse thinking. Your mind wanders, makes connections, surfaces insights.

Problem: these moments happen when you can't type.

You're showering. You're driving. Your hands are full. You're in the middle of something.

By the time you can write it down, it's gone. Or worse — you remember you had an idea but not what it was.

## The Solution: Voice Notes

Talk. Just talk.

Your phone is always with you. Speaking is faster than typing. And you can do it hands-free.

I started recording every idea, every thought, every random musing that felt worth capturing.

It changed everything.

## What I Capture

- Business ideas
- Problems I notice
- Solutions that pop into my head
- Interesting things people say
- Content ideas
- Questions I want to research
- Tasks I suddenly remember
- Connections between ideas

Anything worth remembering. If I'm thinking "I should remember this," I record it.

## The Before/After

**Before voice notes:**
- Maybe 2-3 ideas written down per week
- Constant nagging feeling of "I had something..."
- Ideas felt scarce

**After voice notes:**
- 20-30 captured thoughts per week
- Clear mind (nothing bouncing around)
- Ideas feel abundant

The ideas were always there. I just wasn't catching them.

## How I Use It

### Capture (instant)
See something? Say it. Think something? Say it.

No filtering. No judgment. Just record.

"Note to self: that billboard was interesting because..." [Record]

### Review (daily)
Once a day, I listen back or read transcriptions.

Most notes are noise. That's fine. The 10% that matter get moved into my real systems.

### Process (weekly)
Weekly review: what ideas keep recurring? What patterns am I seeing? What should become projects?

Voice notes are the inbox. Not the system. Eventually, good stuff graduates to real notes or tasks.

## The Setup

For a long time, I used Apple's Voice Memos. Worked fine.

But I wanted transcription, searchability, and organization. And my hands were always full.

So I built [ThinkFlow](/apps/thinkflow).

One tap to record. Speech-to-text that actually works. Search through everything later.

Capture the idea in 5 seconds. Find it whenever you need it.

## Try It

For the next week, whenever you think "I should remember this," record it.

Drive? Record.
Shower? Record (waterproof phone case or just yell at your watch).
Walk? Record.
Can't sleep because thoughts are racing? Record.

You'll be shocked how much you capture. And you'll never go back.
