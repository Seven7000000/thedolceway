## What Makes a Good Pomodoro App?

After testing these apps, here's what matters:

### Must have:
1. **Reliable timer** — Runs in background, doesn't reset
2. **Clear alerts** — Know when your session ends
3. **Break reminders** — The break is part of the technique
4. **Session tracking** — See how many Pomodoros you completed

### Nice to have:
- Custom timer lengths
- Apple Watch / widget
- Statistics
- Task integration

### Red flags:
- Ads interrupting your session
- Premium required for basic features
- Timer resets when you switch apps
- No break functionality

## The Overengineered Problem

Most Pomodoro apps try too hard.

They add:
- Project management
- Team features
- Mood tracking
- Habit formation
- AI coaching

Bro. It's a 25-minute timer.

The original Pomodoro Technique used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer. It worked.

The best app is one that stays out of your way and just... times.

## Do You Need an App?

Honestly? Your phone has a timer built in.

**Use the built-in timer if:**
- You're trying Pomodoro for the first time
- You have strong willpower
- You don't care about tracking

**Use an app if:**
- You want to track your focus hours
- You need the structure (automatic breaks)
- You benefit from stats and streaks
- You want an Apple Watch complication

## Classic vs Modified Pomodoro

**Classic Pomodoro:**
- 25-minute work sessions
- 5-minute short breaks
- 15-30 minute long break after 4 sessions

**Modified Pomodoro:**
- 50-minute work sessions
- 10-minute breaks
- Adjusted for deep work

Most apps let you customize. Start classic, adjust based on what works for you.

## FAQ

**What's the best free Pomodoro app?**
FocusTimer or Pomofocus (web). Both free, no ads, no aggressive upsells.

**Is 25 minutes really optimal?**
For most people, yes. Long enough to make progress, short enough to stay focused.

**Can I extend sessions if I'm in flow?**
Technically against the technique, but real life is flexible. Don't use it as an excuse to skip all breaks.

**Why do some apps charge monthly?**
Because subscriptions are trendy. A timer doesn't need a subscription.

**What about physical timers?**
Great option. Removes phone distraction entirely.
