You've tried meditation. Probably multiple times.

Downloaded the app. Did it for a week. Stopped.

Here's why that happened and how to actually make it stick.

## Why Meditation Habits Fail

### 1. Too long, too fast
"I'll meditate for 20 minutes every day."

Day 1: Enthusiastic.
Day 5: Skipped.
Day 7: App deleted.

### 2. No anchor
"I'll meditate sometime in the morning."

Translation: You won't meditate.

### 3. Expecting fireworks
"I don't feel anything. This isn't working."

Meditation isn't about feeling things. It's about practice.

### 4. Wrong environment
Trying to meditate with notifications, noise, or in an uncomfortable position.

### 5. All or nothing
Miss one day → feel like a failure → give up entirely.

## The Minimum Viable Meditation Habit

**2 minutes. Same time. Every day. No exceptions.**

That's it. That's the whole strategy.

### Why 2 minutes works:
- You can't say you don't have time
- It's small enough to not skip
- You actually do it
- The habit forms before you realize

### Why same time works:
- No decision fatigue
- Becomes automatic
- Attaches to existing routine

### Why every day works:
- Habits need consistency
- Occasional practice = no habit
- Momentum builds

## The 30-Day Build

### Week 1: 2 Minutes
Just 2 minutes. After your morning coffee (or any consistent anchor).

Sit. Close eyes. Focus on breath. 2 minutes.

That's success.

### Week 2: 3-5 Minutes
Still short. Same time. Same place.

If you skip, don't add minutes. Stay at current level.

### Week 3: 5-7 Minutes
Now we're building. You'll notice you WANT to continue.

### Week 4: 10 Minutes
The sweet spot for daily practice. Enough to feel benefits, short enough to sustain.

### After 30 days:
Re-evaluate. Stay at 10 minutes or build to 15-20.

## The Right Way to Meditate

### 1. Posture
- Sit comfortably (chair, cushion, or floor)
- Spine straight but not rigid
- Hands relaxed (on knees or lap)
- Eyes closed (or soft gaze down)

You don't need lotus position. Comfort matters.

### 2. Focus
- Breathe naturally
- Notice your breath (the sensation)
- Don't control it, just observe

### 3. When thoughts come
They will. That's normal. That's not failure.

- Notice the thought
- Label it mentally ("thinking")
- Return to breath
- Repeat

Every return to breath is a rep. Thoughts aren't failure — returning is the practice.

### 4. End gently
Don't jump up. Open eyes slowly. Take a breath. Then move.

## Guided vs Unguided

### Guided meditation:
- Someone talks you through it
- Easier for beginners
- Less mental effort
- Good for specific purposes (sleep, anxiety)

### Unguided meditation:
- Just you and silence (maybe a timer)
- Harder at first
- Develops deeper skill
- More flexible

**My recommendation:** Start guided, transition to unguided over time.

[MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp) has both guided sessions and a simple timer.

## The Anchor Technique

Attach meditation to something you already do.

**Format:** "After [existing habit], I will meditate."

Examples:
- After I pour my coffee, I will meditate for 2 minutes.
- After I sit at my desk, I will meditate for 2 minutes.
- After I brush my teeth at night, I will meditate for 2 minutes.

The existing habit becomes your trigger.

## What to Do When You Miss a Day

You will miss days. Everyone does.

**The rule:** Never miss twice.

Miss once? No big deal. Resume tomorrow.

Miss twice? You're building a new habit (not meditating).

Don't spiral. Don't shame yourself. Just sit again tomorrow.

## The "I Can't Empty My Mind" Problem

You're not supposed to empty your mind.

Meditation is noticing when your mind wanders and bringing it back.

**The process:**
1. Focus on breath
2. Mind wanders
3. Notice it wandered
4. Return to breath
5. Repeat

Step 3-4 is the practice. That's where the benefit comes from.

A "bad" meditation where your mind wandered 100 times and you returned 100 times is actually excellent practice.

## Common Objections

### "I don't have time"
You have 2 minutes. You spent longer reading this section.

### "I can't sit still"
Start with 2 minutes. That's less still-sitting than waiting for coffee.

### "It doesn't work for me"
You've probably never given it enough time. 30 days minimum before judging.

### "I'll do it when I have time"
You'll never have time. Schedule it like any other commitment.

### "I'm not spiritual"
Meditation doesn't require spirituality. It's attention training.

## The Benefits You'll Notice

### Week 1-2:
- Slightly calmer after sessions
- Maybe sleeping better
- "Is this doing anything?"

### Week 3-4:
- Less reactive to stress
- Better focus during work
- Starting to miss it when you skip

### Month 2+:
- Measurably calmer baseline
- Better emotional regulation
- Wouldn't go back to not meditating

The benefits are cumulative and subtle. Then one day you realize you've changed.

## Using an App

Apps help with:
- Guided sessions when you're unsure
- Timer when you don't need guidance
- Streak tracking for motivation
- Progress over time

[MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp) was built for this progression — guided content for beginners, simple timer for experienced practitioners.

## FAQ

**How long does it take to form a meditation habit?**
Research suggests 66 days on average. Give it at least 30.

**When is the best time to meditate?**
Morning is popular (start day right). But any consistent time works.

**Can I meditate lying down?**
You can, but you might fall asleep. Sitting is better for building the skill.

**Is meditation the same as relaxation?**
No. Meditation is attention training. Relaxation is often a side effect.

**What if I hate it?**
Try different types. Breath focus, body scan, walking meditation. Find what fits.
