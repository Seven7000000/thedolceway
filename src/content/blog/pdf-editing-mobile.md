"Can you sign and send back this PDF?"

You're on your phone. Away from a computer.

Do you:
A) Wait until you get home
B) Print, sign, scan (in 2025?)
C) Use an app that actually works

Let's talk about option C.

## What You Actually Need

Most people need exactly 4 PDF capabilities on mobile:

1. **Sign documents** — Add your signature without printing
2. **Fill forms** — Put text in form fields
3. **Merge PDFs** — Combine multiple documents
4. **Annotate** — Highlight, underline, add comments

That's it. Everything else is nice-to-have.

## The Options

### Files App (iOS Built-in)

**What it does:** Basic markup. Simple signature. That's about it.

**What it doesn't:** Merge. Split. Fill forms. OCR.

**Verdict:** Fine for signing one page. Useless for real work.

### Adobe Acrobat

**What it does:** Everything. The full PDF suite.

**What's the catch:** Subscription. Expensive. Also slow and bloated.

**Verdict:** Overkill for most people. But if you need professional features, it's the standard.

### PDF Expert

**What it does:** All the essentials. Fast. Good interface.

**What's the catch:** One-time purchase (good) but not cheap.

**Verdict:** Best for power users willing to pay more.

### Small PDF / iLovePDF

**What it does:** Online converters with mobile apps.

**What's the catch:** Uploads to servers. Privacy concerns. Subscription nagging.

**Verdict:** Convenient but not private.

## What to Look For

### Offline capability
Can you work without internet? If the app uploads everything to servers, your data isn't private and you're stuck without connection.

### Signing workflow
How many taps to add a signature? Good apps: 2-3 taps. Bad apps: 5+ taps plus creating an account.

### Merge and split
Combining PDFs should be drag and drop. Splitting should be visual. Not buried in menus.

### Export options
Can you save to Files? Share to any app? Auto-upload to cloud storage?

### No subscription pressure
Constant upsells ruin the experience. The best apps let you work in peace.

## The Sweet Spot

You don't need the $15/month Adobe subscription.

You need something that:
- Works offline
- Signs quickly
- Merges easily
- Doesn't nag you

## The App

I built [PDFast](/apps/pdfast) because every option was either too expensive, too slow, or too annoying.

Scan documents. Sign with your finger. Merge multiple PDFs. Split pages. Export anywhere.

Desktop-level PDF power. In your pocket.
