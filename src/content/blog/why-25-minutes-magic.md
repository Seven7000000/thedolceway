25 minutes.

Not 20. Not 30. Not "until I finish."

25.

There's a reason the Pomodoro technique uses this specific number. And it's not arbitrary.

## The Attention Span Problem

Your brain wasn't designed for 8-hour focus sessions.

Studies show focused attention starts degrading after about 20-25 minutes. After that, you're not thinking better — you're just grinding through mental fatigue.

The Pomodoro technique works *with* your brain, not against it.

## The Science

### Ultradian Rhythms

Your brain operates in 90-minute cycles of high and low alertness. Within those cycles, there are peaks and troughs.

25 minutes catches the peak. Take a break before you hit the trough.

### Attention Decay

Attention decay curves show performance declining steadily after focused work begins. The steepest drops happen between 20-30 minutes for most tasks.

Working longer without breaks doesn't mean more done. It means diminishing returns.

### The Consolidation Effect

Short breaks allow your brain to consolidate what you just learned or worked on. This is when ideas "click" — not during the grind, but in the pause after.

## Why Not Longer?

"But I get into flow and 25 minutes interrupts it!"

Yes and no.

Flow states are real. But most people use "flow" as an excuse to avoid breaks when they're actually in fatigued grinding mode.

True flow doesn't happen every session. The Pomodoro structure helps you build toward flow rather than forcing it.

And when you ARE in real flow? Skip the break. The technique is a tool, not a prison.

## Why Not Shorter?

20 minutes feels too rushed.

You spend the first 5-10 minutes getting into the work. Leave only 10 minutes of actual productive time.

25 gives you runway to settle in AND do meaningful work.

## The 5-Minute Break

The break matters as much as the work.

During the 5 minutes:
- Step away from the screen
- Move your body
- Let your mind wander
- Don't check social media (that's not resting, that's trading one screen for another)

After 4 pomodoros: take 15-30 minutes. Walk. Eat. Actually disconnect.

## How to Actually Do It

1. Pick ONE task
2. Set timer for 25 minutes
3. Work only on that task (no tabs, no phone, no "quick checks")
4. When timer rings, STOP (even mid-sentence)
5. Take 5 minutes off
6. Repeat

The stopping mid-sentence part sounds counterintuitive. But it makes restarting easier — you know exactly where you left off.

## Common Mistakes

**Too many tasks per pomodoro**
One pomodoro = one task. Not "emails and planning and writing." Pick one.

**Checking phone during break**
Instagram isn't rest. It's more stimulation. Your brain needs actual downtime.

**Ignoring the structure**
"I'll just push through to finish this." Cool. You've just defeated the entire purpose. Take the break.

## The Timer

I built [FocusTimer](/apps/focustimer) because every Pomodoro app I tried was either too complicated or too ugly.

One tap to start. Minimal interface. Gentle audio cues that don't jolt you out of focus.

Just the timer. Nothing else.
