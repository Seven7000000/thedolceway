Growing a human is thirsty work.

Your blood volume increases by 50%. You're building amniotic fluid. Your kidneys are working overtime.

Here's exactly how much water you need during pregnancy — and why it matters more than you think.

## The Official Recommendation

**ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) recommends:**

8-12 cups (64-96oz / 2-3 liters) of water per day during pregnancy.

That's about 10 cups on average — significantly more than the standard 8 cups for non-pregnant adults.

## Trimester-by-Trimester Guide

### First Trimester

**Target:** 8-10 cups (64-80oz / 2-2.4L)

Your blood volume is starting to increase. Many women experience nausea, which makes drinking harder.

**Tips for morning sickness:**
- Small sips throughout the day (not big gulps)
- Cold water with lemon helps some women
- Popsicles count
- Sparkling water if flat water triggers nausea

### Second Trimester

**Target:** 10-12 cups (80-96oz / 2.4-2.8L)

Amniotic fluid is forming. Blood volume continues increasing. You'll probably feel better and can drink more easily.

This is when many women forget to increase their intake because they feel normal again. Don't.

### Third Trimester

**Target:** 10-12 cups (80-96oz / 2.4-2.8L)

Baby is getting bigger. Amniotic fluid needs replenishing. You might feel like you're peeing every 20 minutes — that's normal.

**Note:** Some women need even more in hot weather or if exercising.

## Why Hydration Matters During Pregnancy

This isn't just "health advice." Dehydration during pregnancy can cause:

- **Braxton Hicks contractions** (often triggered by dehydration)
- **Constipation** (already a pregnancy problem — dehydration makes it worse)
- **Urinary tract infections** (concentrated urine = bacteria growth)
- **Headaches and fatigue**
- **Reduced amniotic fluid** (can affect baby's development)
- **Overheating** (your body can't regulate temperature as well when dehydrated)

In severe cases, dehydration can contribute to:
- Preterm labor
- Low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)
- Neural tube defects (early pregnancy)

## Signs You're Not Drinking Enough

**Watch for:**
- Dark yellow urine (should be light yellow to clear)
- Feeling dizzy or lightheaded
- Dry mouth and lips
- Headaches that won't quit
- Infrequent urination (you should be peeing a lot during pregnancy)
- Constipation
- Braxton Hicks that seem to come in clusters

## What Counts as "Water"

**Yes:**
- Plain water
- Sparkling water
- Herbal tea (decaf)
- Milk
- Fruit-infused water

**Partially:**
- Decaf coffee (about 70% counts)
- Juice (counts but watch sugar)
- Soup broth

**No:**
- Caffeinated drinks (limit to 200mg caffeine/day during pregnancy)
- Alcohol (obviously)

## Practical Tips

1. **Start early.** Drink 16oz when you wake up.

2. **Eat your water.** Watermelon, cucumber, oranges, strawberries — all high water content.

3. **Carry a bottle everywhere.** If it's visible, you'll drink more.

4. **Set reminders.** Pregnancy brain is real. You will forget.

5. **Track it.** Even a simple check-mark system helps.

6. **Front-load.** Drink more in the morning/afternoon, less at night (unless you love 3am bathroom trips).

## When to Call Your Doctor

Contact your healthcare provider if you:
- Can't keep water down
- Have dark urine that doesn't improve
- Feel dizzy or faint
- Haven't urinated in 8+ hours
- Notice decreased fetal movement (third trimester)

## Tracking Your Water Intake

Remembering to drink 10+ cups while also remembering prenatal vitamins, doctor's appointments, and everything else?

Hard.

I built [WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) to make this easier. Set your pregnancy-adjusted goal, get smart reminders that don't ping you at 2am, and track with one tap.

Your body is doing incredible work. The least you can do is keep it hydrated.

## FAQ

**Can I drink too much water during pregnancy?**
Technically yes (hyponatremia), but it's rare. Stick to the recommended 10-12 cups spread throughout the day.

**Does water help with pregnancy swelling?**
Counterintuitively, yes. Drinking more water helps your body flush excess sodium and reduce water retention.

**What about sparkling water during pregnancy?**
Totally fine. Some women find it easier to drink when nauseous.

**Should I drink more if I'm exercising?**
Yes. Add 8-16oz for every 30 minutes of exercise.
