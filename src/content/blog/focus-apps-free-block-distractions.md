## Combining Free Tools

The best free setup:

1. **Phone:** iOS Screen Time or Android Digital Wellbeing
2. **Browser:** StayFocusd (Chrome) or LeechBlock (Firefox)
3. **Desktop apps:** Cold Turkey free version
4. **Timer:** FocusTimer

This covers:
- ✅ Social media apps
- ✅ Distracting websites
- ✅ Session timing
- ✅ Zero cost

## The Problem With Free Blockers

They're all bypassable. Even the "unbypassable" ones (use a different browser, different device, etc.).

Free blockers work for people who:
- Need a small nudge
- Have some willpower
- Want awareness more than force

If you need serious blocking:
- **Opal** ($99/year) — Nearly impossible to bypass on iPhone
- **Freedom** ($40/year) — Cross-device blocking
- **Cold Turkey Pro** ($39 one-time) — Full app and site blocking

## Do Blockers Even Work?

Research says: yes, but not magic.

A 2019 study found people who used app blockers:
- Spent 23% less time on blocked apps
- Reported lower stress levels
- Felt more in control

But long-term behavior change requires more than blocking:
- Environment design
- Habit replacement
- Understanding your triggers

Blockers are a tool, not a solution.

## FAQ

**What's the best completely free focus app?**
For blocking: Cold Turkey Blocker (desktop) or Screen Time (iOS). For timing: FocusTimer.

**Can I block YouTube but allow specific channels?**
Not with most free tools. StayFocusd lets you block youtube.com with exceptions, but it's clunky.

**Do focus apps drain battery?**
Minimally. They're much lighter than the apps they're blocking.

**What if I need to access a blocked site?**
Plan ahead. Don't block things you legitimately need for work.

**Is it bad to rely on blockers?**
No more than relying on an alarm clock. Use tools that help you.
