Women's bodies aren't small men's bodies. Shocking, I know.

Yet most hydration advice ignores hormones, menstrual cycles, and the specific needs of women's bodies.

Let's fix that.

## The Baseline for Women

The general recommendation for women is 2.7 liters (91oz) per day from all sources (food + drinks).

From drinks alone: **2-2.5 liters (64-84oz)**

But here's the thing — that's average. You're not average.

## Calculate YOUR Needs

**Simple formula:** Your weight (lbs) × 0.5 = ounces per day

- 120lbs → 60oz (1.8L)
- 140lbs → 70oz (2.1L)
- 160lbs → 80oz (2.4L)
- 180lbs → 90oz (2.7L)

## How Your Menstrual Cycle Affects Hydration

This is the part nobody talks about.

### Days 1-5 (Menstruation)
You're losing fluids. Add **8-16oz (250-500ml)** to your baseline. Also crucial for reducing cramps — dehydration makes them worse.

### Days 6-14 (Follicular Phase)
Estrogen rises. Your body retains water better. Stick to baseline.

### Days 14-16 (Ovulation)
Body temperature rises slightly. Add **8oz (250ml)**.

### Days 17-28 (Luteal Phase)
Progesterone increases. You might feel bloated, but you actually need MORE water to reduce water retention (counterintuitive, I know). Add **8-12oz (250-350ml)**.

## Life Stages

### Pregnancy
Add **10-12oz (300-350ml)** daily. You're building a human. That requires water.

### Breastfeeding
Add **32-40oz (1-1.2L)** daily. Milk production is thirsty work.

### Menopause
Hot flashes increase water loss through sweat. Add **8-16oz (250-500ml)** during symptomatic days.

## Activity Adjustments

- Light exercise (yoga, walking): +12oz (350ml)
- Moderate exercise (jogging, cycling): +20oz (600ml)
- Intense exercise (HIIT, strength training): +32oz+ (1L+)

## Coffee and Wine

Let's be real.

**Coffee:** Count it as half water. A 12oz latte = 6oz toward your goal.

**Wine:** It's a diuretic. For every glass, drink an equal amount of water to offset.

## Signs You Need More Water

Women-specific signs:

- Increased UTI frequency (dehydration = concentrated urine = bacteria party)
- Worse period cramps
- Dry, dull skin (not even expensive serums can fix dehydration)
- Headaches before/during period
- Constipation (especially during luteal phase)

## The Practical Part

Knowing you need 80oz is useless if you forget to drink.

Tips that actually work:

1. **Front-load your intake.** Drink 16oz first thing in the morning.
2. **Water before coffee.** Non-negotiable.
3. **Visible bottle.** If you can see it, you'll drink it.
4. **Smart reminders.** Not annoying hourly pings. Reminders that know your schedule.

I built [WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) specifically because I couldn't find an app that did this right. It calculates your needs, adjusts reminders to your day, and tracks with one tap.

No guilt trips. No dead plants. Just water.

## FAQ

**Does sparkling water count?**
Yes, 100%. Same hydration as still water.

**What about herbal tea?**
Counts as water (unless it has caffeine).

**Should I drink more during workouts?**
Yes. Aim for 4-8oz every 15-20 minutes during exercise.

**Why do I pee so much when I drink more water?**
Your body adjusts. Give it 1-2 weeks. If you're still going every 30 minutes, you might be drinking too fast — spread it out more.
