Your iPhone camera is 48 megapixels.

Pointing it at a document and getting a clean, straight PDF should be easy.

It's not.

I tested every scanner app. Most are garbage.

## Apple Notes (Built-in)

Free. Already on your phone. Decent edge detection.

But your scans live in Notes. Weird. Limited export. No OCR.

**Verdict:** Fine for quick stuff. Not a real solution.

## Adobe Scan

Excellent quality. Good OCR.

Requires Adobe account. Uploads everything to Adobe cloud. Free tier has limits.

**Verdict:** Best quality, but Adobe wants to own your documents.

## Microsoft Lens

Free. Good quality. OneDrive integration.

UI feels corporate. Pushes you toward Microsoft ecosystem.

**Verdict:** Good if you're already in Microsoft land.

## Scanner Pro

Beautiful. Fast. Great OCR. iCloud sync.

$25 lifetime. iOS only.

**Verdict:** Best scanner app on iOS. Worth it if you scan a lot.

## Genius Scan

Fast. Reasonable free tier.

App feels dated. Premium features locked.

**Verdict:** Been around forever. Shows its age.

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

Your finger is in the shot.

You're holding the document flat. The corner curls. You pin it with your thumb.

Now you have a thumb in your scan.

Most apps? Tough luck. Crop it yourself.

## ScanSnap

AI edge detection that actually works. Auto-perspective correction.

Handwriting OCR. Export anywhere.

And here's the thing: **automatic finger removal.**

The AI sees your thumb. Removes it. Clean scan.

It's the feature I didn't know I needed until I was manually cropping every single scan.
