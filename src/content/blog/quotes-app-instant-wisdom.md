When I'm stuck, I don't ask friends. I ask dead people.

Marcus Aurelius. Seneca. Naval Ravikant. Paul Graham. People who've thought deeply about the problems I'm facing.

Usually, they've already solved it. I just need to find the right quote.

## The problem with searching for wisdom

Google "motivational quotes" and you get garbage.

Stock photos with "Live Laugh Love" energy. Misattributed quotes. Pinterest boards full of nonsense nobody actually said.

You're looking for a spark and you get a landfill.

## I wanted a library, not a feed

I didn't want algorithmic quote-of-the-day randomness. I wanted to browse.

Feeling unmotivated? Show me quotes about discipline.
Dealing with failure? Show me quotes about resilience.
Starting something new? Show me quotes about courage.

Curated collections from people who actually did the thing.

## The quotes that changed me

Some quotes hit different. They stick in your brain and change how you see things.

"The obstacle is the way." — Marcus Aurelius

Every problem I face now, I ask: how is this the way forward?

"You're not responsible for your first thought, only your second." — Unknown

Freed me from guilt about intrusive thoughts.

"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." — Chinese Proverb

Stopped me from using "I should have started earlier" as an excuse.

## Why I built Quotes

I wanted instant access to wisdom. Organized. Searchable. Beautiful.

[Quotes](/apps/quotes) is my personal library, turned into an app:

- Thousands of curated quotes (no "Live Laugh Love" garbage)
- Browse by category or mood
- Save the ones that hit
- Daily quote notifications

When you need perspective, you shouldn't have to scroll through junk to find it.

The answers already exist. You just need to find them.
