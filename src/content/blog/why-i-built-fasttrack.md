Intermittent fasting changed my body composition more than any diet I'd ever tried.

No calorie counting. No meal prep. No forbidden foods. Just... eating in a window.

I lost 15 pounds in two months without thinking about food constantly. First time that ever happened.

## Then I tried the apps

Every fasting app I downloaded felt like it was designed by people who'd never actually fasted.

They wanted me to:
- Log my mood before and after eating
- Track my ketone levels (I don't own a ketone meter)
- Read articles about autophagy during my fast
- Join a "fasting community" to share my progress

I don't want a fasting lifestyle platform. I want to know one thing:

**When can I eat?**

That's it. That's the entire product requirement.

## So I built FastTrack

The app does three things:

1. **Pick your protocol.** 16:8. 18:6. 20:4. OMAD. One tap.
2. **Start the timer.** Big button. Can't miss it.
3. **Get notified when your window opens.** "Time to eat." Done.

There's streak tracking because streaks work. Nothing motivates like not wanting to break a 30-day streak.

There's a history view so you can see your consistency. That's it.

No community. No articles. No mood logging. No ketone tracking. No gamification.

## The anti-feature approach

I think most apps fail because they add too much. Every feature is a potential point of friction. Every option is cognitive load.

FastTrack succeeds by removing things.

No account required — your data stays on your device. No subscription — pay once, own forever. No notifications except the one that matters — your eating window.

Constraints breed clarity.

## Results

I've been using FastTrack for my own fasting for six months. My consistency went from "I try to fast most days" to actual streaks of 60+ days.

The difference? Friction. When the app is simple, you use it. When it's complicated, you don't.

FastTrack is launching soon. [Get early access](/apps/fasttrack).
