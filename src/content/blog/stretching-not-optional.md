"I'll stretch later."

You won't.

"I don't have time to stretch."

You have time to be injured for three months?

Let's fix your stretching problem.

## Why You Should Care

You sit all day. Your hip flexors are tight. Your hamstrings are short. Your shoulders are rounded.

Then you go to the gym and load barbells on top of these imbalances.

Result? Injuries. Nagging pain. Getting hurt doing something dumb like picking up a sock.

Stretching isn't just for flexibility. It's injury prevention.

## The Minimum Viable Stretching Routine

**Time:** 5 minutes
**When:** Post-workout, or anytime

### 1. Hip Flexor Stretch (60 seconds each side)

Kneel on one knee. Lunge forward until you feel a stretch in the front of your back leg's hip.

Squeeze your back glute. Slight forward lean. Hold.

**Why:** Your hip flexors are probably the tightest muscles in your body if you sit at a desk.

### 2. Pigeon Pose (60 seconds each side)

From all fours, bring one knee forward and angle it outward. Extend back leg behind you. Sink into it.

**Why:** Opens up the glutes and deep hip rotators. Game-changer for lower back pain.

### 3. Chest Doorway Stretch (60 seconds)

Stand in a doorway. Arms at 90 degrees against the frame. Step through until you feel a stretch in your chest.

**Why:** Counteracts all that hunching over screens.

### 4. Cat-Cow (60 seconds)

On all fours. Arch back up (cat). Drop belly and look up (cow). Flow between them.

**Why:** Mobilizes the entire spine. Feels amazing after sitting.

### 5. Standing Forward Fold (60 seconds)

Stand. Bend forward. Grab elbows. Let your head hang. Relax.

**Why:** Hamstrings and lower back. The whole posterior chain.

## That's It

Five stretches. Five minutes. 

Do it every day. Or at least post-workout.

## The Investment Math

**Time investment:** 5 minutes/day = 30 hours/year

**Potential injury time:** One pulled muscle = 2-8 weeks of no training

30 hours of stretching vs. 200+ hours of recovery. The math is obvious.

## When to Stretch

**Post-workout:** Always. Your muscles are warm and receptive.

**Morning:** Great for mobility and waking up the body.

**After sitting:** Every hour or two if you're at a desk.

**Pre-workout:** Dynamic stretching only. Save static holds for after.

## The App

I built [FlexFlow](/apps/flexflow) because I needed guided stretching that didn't feel like a yoga class.

Timer-based routines. Organized by body part. Just follow along and hold.

No "breathe into your chakras." Just stretches that work.
