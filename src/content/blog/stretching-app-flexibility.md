I couldn't touch my toes.

At 25. Otherwise healthy. Went to the gym regularly. But ask me to reach down and touch my feet? Not happening. Not even close.

I figured I was just "not flexible." Some people are, some people aren't. Genetics.

Wrong.

## Flexibility is a skill

You're not inflexible because of your genes. You're inflexible because you don't stretch.

Your muscles adapt to how you use them. Sit in a chair all day? Your hip flexors shorten. Never reach overhead? Your shoulders tighten.

The body you have is the body you've trained.

## Why you skip stretching

I know why you skip it. I skipped it too.

**It's boring.** Holding a position for 30 seconds feels like forever.

**It doesn't feel productive.** You're not sweating. You're not lifting. It doesn't feel like "real" exercise.

**You don't know what to do.** Random stretches you remember from high school gym class don't make a routine.

**It hurts.** Tight muscles are uncomfortable to stretch. So you avoid it.

## What changed for me

I started treating stretching like training. Not an afterthought. Not something I do if I have time. A real practice.

10 minutes a day. Every day. Same routine.

Within two weeks, I touched my toes for the first time in my adult life.

Within two months, I could palm the floor.

My back pain disappeared. My squat depth improved. I moved better in every way.

## The routine matters

Random stretching doesn't work. You need:

- **Consistency.** Daily beats intense-but-rare.
- **Progression.** Start easy, go deeper over time.
- **Full body coverage.** Not just the areas that hurt.
- **Proper timing.** Hold each stretch long enough to actually create change.

## Why I built FlexFlow

I wanted guided routines I could follow without thinking.

[FlexFlow](/apps/flexflow) gives you:

- Routines organized by body part, duration, and difficulty
- Visual guides with timers for each stretch
- Morning mobility, post-workout recovery, desk break options
- HealthKit integration to track your practice

No thinking required. Just follow along.

You're not inflexible. You're untrained.

10 minutes a day changes that.
