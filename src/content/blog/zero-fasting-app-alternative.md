Zero is the most downloaded fasting app.

But at $70/year for premium, is it worth it? Or would a simple timer work just as well?

Let's compare.

## Zero Fasting App: What You Get

- Basic fasting timer
- Limited history (7 days)

## The Case for Zero

## Who Should Use What

### Use Zero Premium if:
- You want coaching content
- You value the brand/community
- $70/year doesn't bother you
- You're new to fasting and want education

### Use Zero Free if:
- You want to try Zero before committing
- You only need basic tracking
- You don't mind limited history

### Use FastTrack if:
- You want full features without paying
- You know how fasting works, don't need education
- You prefer clean, simple apps
- You want fasting zones included free

### Use Life Fasting if:
- You want to fast with friends
- You want cheaper premium option
- Social accountability motivates you

### Use a basic timer if:
- You're just trying fasting once
- You don't care about tracking
- You have strong discipline without data

## The Real Question

Do you need premium fasting app features?

**You probably don't need premium if:**
- You know your fasting schedule
- You've been fasting for a while
- You just need a timer and zones
- You're self-motivated

**You might benefit from premium if:**
- You're new to fasting and need guidance
- You want detailed health insights
- You value community features
- You find coaching content helpful

## The Honest Take

Zero is a well-made app. But $70/year for a timer with features that free apps include?

That's a tough sell.

[FastTrack](/apps/fasttrack) gives you:
- Unlimited tracking ✅
- Full fasting zones ✅
- History ✅
- Widget ✅
- Apple Watch ✅
- **For free** ✅

The main things Zero Premium has that free alternatives don't:
1. Coaching content (which you can learn free on YouTube)
2. Brand prestige
3. Community (which Life Fasting also has)

If you're paying for knowledge, fine. If you're paying for a timer, look elsewhere.

## FAQ

**Is Zero worth $70/year?**
For most people, no. The free alternatives have the core features you need.

**What's the best free Zero alternative?**
FastTrack for features, Life Fasting for social features.

**Does the free version of Zero work?**
Yes, but 7-day history is limiting for tracking progress.

**Can I switch from Zero to another app?**
Yes, but you can't export your history. Start fresh.
