"What's your sign?"

Most people answer with their sun sign. Aries. Gemini. Scorpio.

But your sun sign is just one piece. A complete birth chart has planets across 12 signs and 12 houses.

Here's what actually matters.

## What Is a Birth Chart?

A snapshot of the sky at the exact moment you were born.

Where was the sun? The moon? Mercury, Venus, Mars? Each planet was in a specific zodiac sign and house.

All together, this creates your unique astrological profile.

## The Big Three

If you only know three things, know these:

### Sun Sign — Your Core Identity
This is the sign most people know. Where the sun was when you were born.

It represents your core self. Your ego. Your basic nature.

**Example:** Leo sun = naturally confident, creative, loves attention.

### Moon Sign — Your Emotional Nature
Where the moon was at your birth.

This is your inner self. How you feel. How you process emotions. What makes you feel secure.

**Example:** Cancer moon = deeply emotional, needs security, values home.

Your sun is how you shine. Your moon is how you feel.

### Rising Sign (Ascendant) — Your First Impression
The sign that was rising on the eastern horizon at your birth time.

This is your social mask. How you appear to others. Your automatic way of engaging with the world.

**Example:** Scorpio rising = comes across as intense, mysterious, observant.

Your sun is who you are. Your rising is who you appear to be.

## The Personal Planets

Beyond the big three, these planets have strong influence:

### Mercury — How You Think and Communicate
In Gemini? Quick-witted, chatty.
In Capricorn? Strategic, measured.

### Venus — How You Love and What You Value
In Libra? Romantic, values harmony.
In Aries? Passionate, values independence.

### Mars — How You Take Action and Handle Conflict
In Aries? Aggressive, direct.
In Pisces? Passive, avoids confrontation.

## The Houses

Signs show how. Houses show where.

Each house represents an area of life:

- **1st House:** Self, appearance
- **4th House:** Home, family
- **7th House:** Relationships, partnerships
- **10th House:** Career, public image

A planet's house position shows where that energy expresses itself.

**Example:** Venus in the 7th house = love energy focused on partnerships. Relationships are central to your life.

## How to Get Your Chart

You need three things:
1. Date of birth
2. Time of birth (exact is best, but approximate works)
3. Location of birth

With these, any astrology app can calculate your full chart in seconds.

## Why Birth Time Matters

Without an exact birth time, you can't know your rising sign or house placements.

The rising sign changes roughly every 2 hours. So if you don't know your birth time, that whole layer is missing.

Check your birth certificate or ask a parent if you don't know.
