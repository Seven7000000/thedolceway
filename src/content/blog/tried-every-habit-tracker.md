I've tried every habit tracking method you can think of.

Bullet journals. Notion templates. Complex apps with gamification. Spreadsheets. Calendar apps. Sticky notes.

Most of them failed. Here's what I learned.

## Method 1: Paper Bullet Journal

**The appeal:** Analog. Intentional. Instagram-worthy.

**Reality:** I spent more time making it pretty than actually tracking habits. And I'd forget to bring it places.

**Why it failed:** Too much friction. Too easy to skip "just one day" when the notebook isn't in front of you.

**Verdict:** Works for some personality types. Not mine.

## Method 2: Notion Templates

**The appeal:** Customizable. Looks organized. Database-powered tracking.

**Reality:** I spent three hours building the perfect template. Used it for four days. Never opened it again.

**Why it failed:** Too complex. Too many clicks to log a simple habit. Too easy to forget it exists.

**Verdict:** Powerful tool. Terrible for daily habits.

## Method 3: Complex Habit Apps

**The appeal:** Gamification. Social features. Data visualization.

**Reality:** The app wanted to know my mood, my weather, my location, my notes, my photo for the day...

I just wanted to check a box.

**Why it failed:** Feature bloat. Every extra feature is friction that adds up.

**Verdict:** Built for engagement metrics, not for building habits.

## Method 4: Spreadsheets

**The appeal:** Complete control. Data lives forever. No subscription.

**Reality:** Opening a spreadsheet every day feels like work.

**Why it failed:** No mobile-friendly option that doesn't suck.

**Verdict:** Good for analysis. Bad for daily use.

## Method 5: The Method That Works

Simple app. Tap to check. See streak. Nothing else.

That's it.

No mood logging. No social sharing. No streak freezes. No complicated statistics.

Just:
- Did I do the thing? Yes. [Check]
- How many days in a row? [Number]

## Why Simple Wins

**Friction is the enemy.**
Every extra step reduces the chance you'll log consistently. 

**Streaks create accountability.**
Don't break the chain. Simple psychological hook that actually works.

**Less is more.**
The apps with the most features have the lowest retention. The apps that do one thing well get used forever.

## My Current System

1. **5-7 habits maximum.** More than that and nothing feels special.
2. **One tap to log.** Open app, tap, done. Under 3 seconds.
3. **Morning review.** Check what's pending. Evening: check what's done.
4. **Protect the streak.** The longer it gets, the more motivated I am to not break it.

## What I Built

I built [SimpleStreaks](/apps/simplestreaks) because nothing else was simple enough.

Add a habit. Check it off. Watch the streak grow.

No gamification. No social features. No complexity.

Just streaks that keep you accountable.

Turns out that's all you need.
