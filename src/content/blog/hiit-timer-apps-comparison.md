## What to Look for in a HIIT Timer

### Must have:
- **Clear audio cues** — You can't look at your phone mid-burpee
- **Prep time option** — Get set before work starts
- **Easy configuration** — Don't spend 5 minutes setting up a 4-minute workout

### Nice to have:
- **Apple Watch app** — Leave phone aside
- **Custom sounds** — Different cues for work vs rest
- **Saved workouts** — Don't reconfigure every time

### Red flags:
- **Ads during workout** — Nothing ruins HIIT like a 30-second ad
- **Complex setup** — Should take seconds, not minutes
- **Bad audio** — Quiet or unclear cues

## DIY Alternative: Your Phone Timer

In a pinch, you can:
1. Set a timer for your work period
2. Reset for rest period
3. Repeat

**Problems:**
- Interrupts your flow
- Easy to lose count
- No prep time

Use a dedicated app. It's free.
