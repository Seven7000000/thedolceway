There's a rule from David Allen's Getting Things Done that changed how I operate:

**If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately.**

Don't add it to a list. Don't schedule it. Don't "come back to it later."

Just do it. Now.

## Why It Works

Most of your to-do list isn't hard tasks. It's small tasks you keep postponing.

- Reply to that email
- Put the dishes away
- Send that file
- Make that appointment
- Water that plant

Each takes 2 minutes or less. But they accumulate into this overwhelming backlog that weighs on you mentally.

The 2-minute rule kills them before they pile up.

## The Math

Let's say you have 10 small tasks throughout the day.

**Without the rule:**
- Add each to to-do list: 30 seconds each
- Remember them later: mental load
- Do them in a batch: Still 2 minutes each
- Total: 20 minutes + mental overhead of carrying a list

**With the rule:**
- Just do them: 2 minutes each
- Total: 20 minutes + zero mental overhead

Same time. Less stress. Empty list.

## How to Apply It

### 1. Process inputs in real-time

Email comes in requesting a simple response? Reply now. Don't flag it.

Notification to update something? Update it. Don't add it to your task manager.

### 2. Estimate honestly

The trap: thinking tasks take longer than they do.

That email you've been avoiding? Actually takes 90 seconds.

Most things feel bigger in our heads than they are. Do a quick mental estimate. If it's under 2 minutes, go.

### 3. Don't batch small tasks

"I'll do all my quick tasks at 4pm."

You won't. And even if you do, you've been carrying mental load all day.

Small tasks done immediately = mental freedom.

### 4. Make exceptions for focus time

If you're in the middle of deep work, don't interrupt yourself.

The 2-minute rule applies to task processing mode, not focus mode. Know the difference.

## What Changes

After a week of applying this:

- My to-do list got shorter (obviously)
- My email inbox stayed near-zero
- I felt lighter (fewer open loops)
- I procrastinated less (nothing to procrastinate on)

The rule doesn't help with big, hard tasks. But it eliminates the small stuff that makes big tasks feel even more overwhelming.

## Start Today

Next time something comes up that takes under 2 minutes:

Don't write it down.
Don't schedule it.
Don't think about it.

Just do it. Then move on.

For the actual focused work, you still need structure. [FocusTimer](/apps/focustimer) handles that — proper Pomodoro sessions for the hard stuff.

But the small stuff? 2-minute rule. Always.
