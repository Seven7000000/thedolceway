I thought meditation was for monks and hippies.

Sit still for an hour? Think about nothing? My brain doesn't work like that. I have too much going on. Meditation isn't for people like me.

That's what I told myself for years.

## Then I actually tried it

Not 30 minutes. Not some 40-day course. Just 2 minutes.

Set a timer. Sat down. Closed my eyes. Focused on my breath.

My mind wandered after about 4 seconds. I brought it back. It wandered again. I brought it back again.

The timer went off. That was it.

I felt... different. Not enlightened. Not transformed. Just slightly less chaotic.

## The myth of the empty mind

Here's what nobody tells you about meditation: you're not supposed to think about nothing.

That's impossible. Your brain generates thoughts. That's its job.

Meditation is noticing when you've drifted and gently coming back. That's the whole practice. The wandering IS the workout. Every time you notice and return, you're strengthening your attention muscle.

If your mind wanders 50 times in 2 minutes, you just did 50 reps.

## Why most meditation apps fail

I tried the popular ones. They all wanted commitment I couldn't give.

- 10-day intro courses before you can use the app properly
- 20-minute minimum sessions
- Subscriptions that cost more than Netflix
- Guilt trips when you miss a day

I didn't need a meditation lifestyle. I needed a reset button for my brain.

## So I built something simpler

The app does three things:

1. Sessions from 2 to 30 minutes — you pick
2. Guided or unguided — your choice
3. Streak tracking — because consistency matters

No courses. No certificates. No social features. No judgment.

Open the app. Pick your time. Breathe. Done.

## The results

I've meditated for 90+ days now. Most sessions are 5-10 minutes. Some are 2 minutes when I'm busy.

The changes are subtle but real:

- I react slower to things that used to trigger me instantly
- I notice my thoughts instead of just having them
- Stress still hits, but it doesn't stick as long

I'm not a monk. I'm just someone who takes 5 minutes to breathe.

## Start smaller than you think

If you've tried meditation and failed, you probably started too big.

Don't do 20 minutes. Do 2. Don't commit to a course. Just sit once.

The bar is on the floor. Step over it.

[Meditation](/apps/meditationapp) is launching soon. It's the app I built for people who think they can't meditate.

Turns out, you can.
