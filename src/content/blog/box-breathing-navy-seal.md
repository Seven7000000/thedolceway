Navy SEALs don't have the luxury of anxiety.

When bullets are flying, panic kills. So they train to control their stress response at will.

Their tool? Box breathing.

And you don't need to be in combat to use it.

## What Is Box Breathing?

Four equal parts. Like a box:

1. **Inhale** — 4 seconds
2. **Hold** — 4 seconds
3. **Exhale** — 4 seconds
4. **Hold** — 4 seconds

Repeat.

That's it. Four seconds each. Four sides of a box.

## Why It Works

Your nervous system has two modes:

**Sympathetic:** Fight or flight. Stress. Anxiety. Racing heart.

**Parasympathetic:** Rest and digest. Calm. Recovery. Slow heart rate.

Your breath is the switch between them.

When you control your breath — slow, rhythmic, extended exhales — you directly stimulate the parasympathetic system.

Box breathing forces slow, controlled breathing. Your body responds by calming down.

It's not magic. It's physiology.

## When to Use It

### Before stressful situations
Big meeting. Important call. Public speaking. First date.

2-3 minutes of box breathing beforehand. Walk in calm.

### During anxiety
Panic attack coming. Heart racing. Thoughts spiraling.

Stop. Box breathe. The physical act interrupts the mental spiral.

### To improve focus
Before deep work. Before studying. Before anything requiring concentration.

A calm nervous system focuses better than a wired one.

### To fall asleep
Racing thoughts keeping you awake? Box breathing slows everything down.

Try it for 5 minutes in bed. Most people don't make it to 5 minutes before drifting off.

## How to Do It (Step by Step)

### 1. Get comfortable
Sit or lie down. Doesn't matter. Just be still.

### 2. Breathe in through your nose (4 seconds)
Deep breath. Fill your belly, then your chest.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

### 3. Hold (4 seconds)
Lungs full. Don't tense up. Just pause.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

### 4. Exhale slowly through your mouth (4 seconds)
Controlled release. All the way out.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

### 5. Hold (4 seconds)
Lungs empty. Wait.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

### 6. Repeat
4-5 rounds minimum. More if needed.

## Common Mistakes

**Going too fast**
4 seconds feels long when you're stressed. That's the point. Slow down.

**Shallow breaths**
Breathe into your belly. If only your chest moves, you're breathing too shallow.

**Forcing it**
If 4 seconds is too hard, start with 3. The rhythm matters more than the specific count.

**Giving up too early**
The calm doesn't hit immediately. Give it at least 4-5 rounds.
