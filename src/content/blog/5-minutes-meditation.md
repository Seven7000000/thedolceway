I resisted meditation for years.

It seemed like something for people who wear crystals and talk about chakras. Not for me.

Then I actually tried it. And it changed things I didn't expect.

## The Resistance

My excuses were creative:

- "I can't quiet my mind"
- "I don't have time"
- "It's too woo-woo"
- "I'm not stressed enough to need it"

Every single one was wrong.

## The Experiment

One month. 5 minutes per day. Every morning, right after waking up.

No apps with 30-day programs. No guided journeys to find my inner self.

Just sat down, set a timer, focused on my breath.

Thoughts came. I noticed them. Returned to breath. Repeat.

## Week 1: This Is Stupid

I felt nothing.

5 minutes felt like 20. My brain churned constantly. I was sure I was "doing it wrong."

I kept going anyway.

## Week 2: Something Shifted

I noticed I was less reactive during the day.

Someone cut in line? Usually I'd be irritated. Now I just... noticed it. And moved on.

Small things weren't bothering me as much.

## Week 3: The Observer

This is hard to explain.

I started experiencing a gap between stimulus and response. Something would happen, and instead of immediately reacting, there was a tiny pause.

In that pause, I could choose how to respond.

This is what meditation actually trains. Not calm. Choice.

## Week 4: New Normal

5 minutes felt short. I extended to 10.

The racing thoughts still came. But they felt less urgent. Like they were on a screen I was watching, not in my head owning me.

## What Changed Specifically

**Reactivity decreased**
I stopped snapping at people. Frustrations rolled off easier.

**Sleep improved**
Falling asleep faster. Fewer racing thoughts at night.

**Focus improved**
Ability to sit with one task without checking my phone constantly.

**Anxiety reduced**
Still there. But lower volume. More manageable.

## What Meditation Actually Is

It's not about clearing your mind. That's impossible.

It's about noticing your thoughts without getting lost in them. Training the skill of attention.

Every time you notice you've wandered and return to breath, that's one rep. It's exercise for attention.

## How to Actually Start

### Make it absurdly small
5 minutes. That's it. Don't try for 20.

### Same time every day
I do it immediately after waking. Before coffee, phone, anything.

### Expect nothing
You're not trying to achieve a state. You're practicing noticing.

### When thoughts come (and they will)
Notice: "Oh, I'm thinking." Then return to breath. No judgment.

## The Tool

I built [Meditation](/apps/meditationapp) for people who don't identify as "meditators."

2 minutes to 30 minutes. Guided or unguided. Simple, beautiful interface.

No 40-day programs. No enlightenment promises. Just sitting with yourself for a few minutes a day.

That's all it takes.
