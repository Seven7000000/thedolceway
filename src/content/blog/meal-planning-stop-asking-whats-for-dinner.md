The question haunts you daily.

"What should we eat tonight?"

You open the fridge. Stare at random ingredients. Close the fridge. Repeat three times.

Eventually you give up and order Thai food.

$40 later, you feel guilty. You have food at home. You just couldn't figure out how to combine it into a meal.

## Decision fatigue is real

You make thousands of decisions every day. Each one depletes your mental energy.

By evening, you're tapped out. The cognitive load of "figure out dinner" feels impossible.

So you default to the easiest option: don't decide. Order something.

## The fix: decide once

What if you made all your dinner decisions at once?

Sunday afternoon. 15 minutes. Plan the whole week.

Now when 6pm hits, you don't decide. You just execute. The decision was already made when you had mental energy.

Monday: Tacos.
Tuesday: Stir fry.
Wednesday: Pasta.

No thinking. No fridge-staring. No guilt.

## The bonus: automatic shopping lists

When you plan meals, you know exactly what you need.

No more buying random ingredients and hoping they become dinner. No more missing one thing and having to make a second trip. No more food waste.

The shopping list writes itself.

## Why I built MealPlanner

[MealPlanner](/apps/mealplanner) makes weekly planning dead simple:

- **Visual calendar** — drag meals onto days
- **Recipe database** — browse ideas when you're stuck
- **Auto shopping list** — knows what you need based on what you planned
- **Favorites** — save meals your family actually likes

15 minutes on Sunday. Zero decisions at 6pm.

Takeout becomes a choice, not a default.

Your wallet will thank you. Your health will thank you.

Plan the food. Eat the food.
