I drink water like a camel. Two sips at 9am. Nothing until dinner. Then I wonder why I have a headache.

So I downloaded every water tracking app. Used them for weeks. Most are trash. Here's the truth.

## WaterMinder

Pretty. Apple Watch support. 47 settings to configure.

But I don't want to spend 30 minutes setting up a water app. I want to drink water.

**Verdict:** Over-engineered.

## Plant Nanny

Your plant dies if you don't drink. Cute for a week. Then you've murdered 6 plants and feel guilty.

**Verdict:** Guilt-trip gamification. Delete.

## Drink Water Reminder

Free. Ugly. Ads every 3 seconds. Notifications feel random.

**Verdict:** You get what you pay for.

## Hydro Coach

Calculates your needs based on weight, weather, activity, moon phase, whatever.

Bro. I just want to drink more water.

**Verdict:** I need a reminder, not a PhD.

## The Problem With All Of Them

They fall into two traps:

**Too simple** — Just a counter that spams you with notifications.

**Too complex** — Weather integration, exercise sync, 47 customization options.

Nobody needs either.

## What Actually Works

Smart reminders that know when to nudge you. One-tap logging. A streak that makes you not want to break it.

That's it. That's the whole app.

Couldn't find one that did just that. So I built it.

## WaterDrop

Clean. Smart reminders that adapt to YOUR schedule. One tap to log. Streaks that actually motivate.

No weather integration. No plant murder. No configuration hell.

Just drink your water.
