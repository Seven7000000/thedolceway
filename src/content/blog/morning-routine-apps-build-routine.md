Everyone tells you to have a morning routine.

Nobody tells you how to build one that doesn't fall apart by Thursday.

These apps help.

## Why Morning Routines Matter

The first hour of your day sets the tone.

Win the morning:
- Less reactive, more intentional
- Important tasks done before distractions
- Compound effect over months/years

Lose the morning:
- Start in catch-up mode
- Day controlled by other people's priorities
- Stress carries through

A routine removes decisions. You don't think about what to do — you just do it.

## What to Include in a Morning Routine

There's no perfect routine. But successful routines often include:

**Basics:**
- Hydration (water before coffee)
- Movement (even 5 minutes)
- Mindfulness (meditation, journaling, or just quiet time)

**Optional:**
- Exercise
- Reading
- Affirmations
- Cold shower
- Journaling
- Planning the day

**The key:** Keep it short enough to actually do. 30-60 minutes is plenty.

### 1. SimpleStreaks

**Price:** Free

Not a routine builder — a habit tracker. But sometimes that's all you need.

3. Build streaks for consistency

**Why it works:**
- Visual progress (streaks motivate)

- No complexity

### 2. Fabulous

**Price:** Free trial, then $100/year
**Best for:** Building routines from scratch

A full "habit coaching" app with morning routine focus.

**How it works:**
- "Journeys" guide you to build routines slowly
- Starts with one habit, adds more over time
- Coaching content explains the why

**Why it works:**
- Doesn't overwhelm you with 10 habits day one
- Science-backed approach
- Beautiful design

**The catch:**
- Expensive
- Lots of content to get through

### 3. Routinery

**Price:** Free (Premium $40/year)
**Best for:** Timed routine flow

Guides you through your routine step by step with timers.

**How it works:**
1. Create your routine with time estimates
2. App shows each step with countdown
3. Sounds notify when to move on

**Why it works:**
- No thinking — just follow the app
- Prevents spending 20 minutes on a 5-minute task
- Keeps you on track

**Best for:** People who lose track of time or need structure.

### 4. Finch

**Price:** Free
**Best for:** Gentle accountability

You raise a virtual bird by completing self-care tasks.

**How it works:**
- Complete routines → bird grows
- Skip routines → bird is sad (but supportive)
- Focus on self-care, not productivity

**Why it works:**
- Gentler than aggressive trackers
- Doesn't shame you for misses
- Actually kind of cute

**Best for:** People who respond to nurturing more than numbers.

### 5. Productive

**Price:** Free (Premium $30/year)
**Best for:** Flexible habit timing

Set habits for specific times of day with flexible scheduling.

**How it works:**
- Assign habits to morning, afternoon, evening

**Why it works:**
- Flexible timing
- Good free version
- Clean interface

## Building a Morning Routine (Without Apps)

Apps help, but the principles matter more:

### Start tiny
Don't create a 2-hour routine. Start with 15 minutes. Build up.

### Same time every day
Consistency beats perfection. 6am every day beats "whenever I wake up."

### Front-load the important stuff
The most important habit should be first. That way you do it even if everything else falls apart.

### Prepare the night before
Lay out workout clothes. Prep the coffee. Remove morning friction.

### Don't check your phone
Email and social media put you in reactive mode. Avoid for first 30-60 minutes.

## My Recommended Morning Routine Stack

If you're starting from zero:

**Week 1-2:**
- Wake up at consistent time
- Drink water (before coffee)
- 2 minutes of stretching

**Week 3-4:**
Add one of:
- 5 minutes meditation ([MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp))
- Journal (3 things you're grateful for)
- Read for 10 minutes

**Week 5+:**
Add one of:
- Exercise (even 15 minutes)
- Plan the day
- Affirmations ([Affirmations](/apps/affirmations))

Track with [SimpleStreaks](/apps/simplestreaks).

## Why Morning Routines Fail

### 1. Too ambitious
"I'll wake up at 5am, exercise for an hour, meditate, journal, and read."

You won't. Start smaller.

### 2. No flexibility
Life happens. A routine that can't handle an early meeting or late night isn't sustainable.

### 3. No purpose
Why are you doing this? Without a clear reason, motivation fades.

### 4. Wrong time
If you're not a morning person, a 5am routine won't stick. Work with your biology.

### 5. No tracking
Without tracking, you don't know if you're consistent. You probably aren't.

## FAQ

**What's the best morning routine?**
The one you'll actually do. Start small, build up.

**How long should a morning routine be?**
15-60 minutes is typical. Quality over length.

**Do I need an app for a morning routine?**
No. But apps help with consistency and tracking.

**What if I'm not a morning person?**
Shift your routine slightly later, or focus on evening routines instead.

**Should I exercise in the morning?**
If you can stick to it, morning exercise is great. But any consistent exercise time works.
