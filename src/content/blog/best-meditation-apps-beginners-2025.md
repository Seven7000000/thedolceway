I wanted to meditate. Not join a cult.

Every app wanted me to commit to a 30-day journey. Learn about chakras. Watch videos about "manifesting abundance."

I just wanted to sit quietly for 5 minutes.

Here's what I found.

## Headspace

Best beginner course. Andy's voice is calming.

$70/year. Free tier is basically a demo. Pushes you toward long courses.

**Verdict:** Good if you'll pay. The Basics course is legit.

## Calm

Sleep stories are amazing. Daily Calm is nice.

$70/year. More about sleep than meditation. Matthew McConaughey costs extra. Yes, really.

**Verdict:** Get this if you can't sleep. Not for meditation.

## Insight Timer

Massive free library. Community features.

Overwhelming. Quality varies wildly. Half the meditations are woo-woo nonsense.

**Verdict:** Best free option if you can filter through the garbage.

## Ten Percent Happier

Practical. Skeptic-friendly. Good teachers.

$100/year. Lots of video content you won't watch.

**Verdict:** Best for people who think meditation is weird but want to try it.

## Waking Up (Sam Harris)

Intellectually rigorous. No spiritual fluff.

$100/year. Sam's style isn't for everyone. More philosophy than beginner-friendly.

**Verdict:** Great if you want to think about consciousness. Not where beginners should start.

## The Dirty Secret

These apps make money by making meditation seem complicated.

Courses. Journeys. Programs. Levels.

Here's what meditation actually is:

1. Sit down
2. Close your eyes
3. Focus on your breath
4. Mind wanders. Notice it.
5. Return to breath
6. Repeat

That's it. Everything else is premium content.

## What I Actually Wanted

Open app. Pick a timer (2 min, 5 min, 10 min). Maybe get some guidance. Close app.

No 40-day commitment. No courses. No journey.

Just sit down and breathe.

## Meditation

That's what I built.

Sessions from 2 to 30 minutes. Guided when you want it. Unguided when you don't.

Streak calendar to keep you consistent. Ambient sounds when you want them.

No courses. No commitment. Just calm.
