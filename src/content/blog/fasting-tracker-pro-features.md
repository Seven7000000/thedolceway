My fasting timer got me started.

Pick a protocol. Start the timer. Get notified when to eat. Simple.

But after six months, I wanted more.

- What's my average fasting duration over time?
- How consistent am I really?
- Can I create custom protocols beyond the standard options?
- Where's my historical data?

The simple app didn't have answers. It was designed for starting, not for staying.

## The progression problem

Beginner tools are great for beginners.

But you're not a beginner forever. You develop. You have questions. You want data.

And then you're stuck. Do you:
- Keep using the beginner tool and miss out on insights?
- Switch to a complicated app that overwhelms you with features?
- Use spreadsheets and cobble together your own system?

None of these options are great.

## What experienced fasters need

**History.** Not just today's fast. Every fast. Searchable. Exportable.

**Analytics.** Average duration. Completion rate. Trends over time.

**Custom protocols.** Beyond 16:8 and OMAD. Whatever works for you.

**Flexibility.** Sometimes life happens. Adjust on the fly.

**No judgment.** Data, not guilt. Information, not lectures.

## Why I built FastTrack Pro

[FastTrack Pro](/apps/fasttrack2) is for fasters who've graduated from basics:

- **Complete fasting history** — every fast you've ever done
- **Analytics dashboard** — see patterns, trends, consistency
- **Custom protocol builder** — create any fasting schedule
- **Data export** — your data is yours
- **Advanced insights** — metabolic zone tracking, goal progress

Same simple interface. Much more power under the hood.

If you're still on a basic timer, that's fine. Keep using it.

But when you're ready for more, FastTrack Pro is waiting.
