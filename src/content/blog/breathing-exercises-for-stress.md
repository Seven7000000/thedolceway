Stress hits and your body reacts.

Heart rate spikes. Breathing gets shallow. Thoughts race. You're in fight-or-flight mode for a situation that doesn't require fighting or fleeing.

Here's the hack: your breath is a remote control for your nervous system.

Change your breathing, change your state. It takes less than two minutes.

## Why breathing works

Your autonomic nervous system has two modes:

**Sympathetic:** Fight or flight. Stress response. Shallow, rapid breathing.

**Parasympathetic:** Rest and digest. Calm response. Slow, deep breathing.

Here's the key: while you can't directly control your heart rate or stress hormones, you can control your breathing. And your breathing influences everything else.

Slow, controlled breaths signal to your nervous system that you're safe. It shifts you from sympathetic to parasympathetic. Physiologically.

This isn't woo-woo. It's biology.

## Technique 1: Box Breathing

Used by Navy SEALs to stay calm under pressure. Dead simple.

**How to do it:**

1. Inhale for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 4 seconds
3. Exhale for 4 seconds
4. Hold for 4 seconds
5. Repeat 4 times

Total time: about 2 minutes.

**When to use it:** Before a stressful meeting. When anxiety spikes. Whenever you need to calm down fast.

## Technique 2: 4-7-8 Breathing

Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil. Great for sleep and deep relaxation.

**How to do it:**

1. Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds
2. Hold your breath for 7 seconds
3. Exhale through your mouth for 8 seconds
4. Repeat 4 times

The long exhale is the key. It activates the parasympathetic response.

**When to use it:** Before bed. When you can't sleep. When you need to really slow down.

## Technique 3: Physiological Sigh

The fastest way to calm down. One breath, immediate effect.

**How to do it:**

1. Take a deep breath in through your nose
2. At the top of the inhale, sneak in a second small inhale
3. Long, slow exhale through your mouth

That's it. One breath.

The double inhale reinflates the tiny air sacs in your lungs that collapse when you're stressed. The long exhale slows your heart rate immediately.

**When to use it:** Acute stress. Panic moments. Need to calm down in 10 seconds.

## Making it a practice

These techniques work in the moment. But they work better with practice.

Like any skill, breathing gets easier the more you do it. Your body learns the pattern. The calming effect becomes faster and deeper.

Even 2 minutes a day of intentional breathing practice makes a difference.

## The tool

Remembering which technique is which — and doing it correctly — is hard when you're stressed.

I built [Breathing Exercises](/apps/breathingexercises) to solve this. Visual guides you can follow eyes-closed. Techniques organized by purpose (calm, energy, sleep). Session tracking to build the habit.

No subscription. No account. Just breathing tools that work.

Your breath is always with you. Might as well learn to use it.
