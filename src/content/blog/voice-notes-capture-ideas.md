The shower is where ideas go to die.

You're standing there, water running, and suddenly everything clicks. The solution to that problem you've been stuck on. The perfect angle for that project. The thing you should have said in that meeting.

By the time you're dried off and at your computer, it's gone. Evaporated like the steam.

## Your brain works differently when you're moving

There's science behind this. Walking, showering, driving — activities that occupy your body but not your mind — put your brain into a diffuse mode of thinking.

This is where connections happen. Where creativity lives.

But these moments share a problem: your hands are busy. You can't type.

## The voice note solution

Your voice is always available.

Walking? Talk to your phone.
Driving? Talk to your phone.
Shower? Your phone is probably waterproof now. Talk to your phone.

But raw voice notes have problems:

- Hard to search later
- Hard to organize
- You have to listen to the whole thing to find what you said
- Eventually you have 200 voice memos and no idea what's in them

## Voice notes that become text

The solution is transcription. Talk → text.

Now your ideas are:
- Searchable (find that thing you said three weeks ago)
- Skimmable (don't relisten, just read)
- Organizable (tags, folders, categories)
- Actionable (copy the text, use it somewhere)

## Why I built ThinkFlow

[ThinkFlow](/apps/thinkflow) captures ideas the way they happen:

- **One-tap recording** — friction is the enemy of capture
- **Accurate transcription** — your words become searchable text
- **Organized library** — tags and folders to find things later
- **Works offline** — no internet needed to record

Think out loud. The app does the rest.

Your best ideas shouldn't die in the shower.

Capture them. All of them. Figure out what to do with them later.
