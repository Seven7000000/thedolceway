You're lying in bed. Exhausted. But your brain won't shut up.

Racing thoughts. Replaying conversations. Planning tomorrow. Worrying about yesterday.

Sound familiar?

The 4-7-8 technique was designed exactly for this.

## What Is 4-7-8?

Developed by Dr. Andrew Weil. He calls it a "natural tranquilizer for the nervous system."

The pattern:
1. **Inhale** through nose for **4** seconds
2. **Hold** for **7** seconds
3. **Exhale** through mouth for **8** seconds

That's it. One cycle.

Do 4 cycles. Maximum effect.

## Why It Works

### The extended exhale
Your exhale is twice as long as your inhale (8 vs 4).

Extended exhales activate the parasympathetic nervous system — your "rest and digest" mode. Heart rate slows. Muscles relax.

### The hold
7 seconds of holding allows oxygen to saturate your bloodstream. Creates a calming effect throughout your body.

### The focus
Counting forces you to focus on something other than your racing thoughts. Gives your brain a simple task.

## How to Do It (Step by Step)

### Position
Lie on your back. Tongue touching the roof of your mouth, behind your front teeth. Keep it there the whole time.

### Step 1: Exhale completely
Before the first cycle, exhale all the air from your lungs through your mouth. Make a "whoosh" sound.

### Step 2: Inhale (4 seconds)
Close your mouth. Inhale quietly through your nose.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

### Step 3: Hold (7 seconds)
Hold your breath. Don't tense up. Just pause.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

### Step 4: Exhale (8 seconds)
Exhale completely through your mouth. Make the "whoosh" sound again.

Count: 1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8...

### Step 5: Repeat
That's one cycle. Do 4 cycles total.

Most people don't finish all 4 before drifting off.

## Tips for Success

### Practice during the day first
Don't save it for bedtime. Practice a few times when you're not trying to sleep. Get comfortable with the pattern.

### Don't force the count
If 7 seconds feels too long to hold, scale everything down proportionally. 2-3.5-4. The ratio matters more than the exact seconds.

### Use it for anxiety too
This isn't just for sleep. Use it before stressful situations. In the middle of an anxious moment. Whenever you need to calm your nervous system.

### Be consistent
Dr. Weil recommends doing it twice a day for 6-8 weeks. The effects compound over time. Your nervous system learns to respond faster.

## When to Use It

- **Before bed:** The obvious one. 4 cycles as you lie down.
- **Middle of the night:** Woke up, can't get back to sleep? Do 4 cycles.
- **Before stressful events:** Meeting, presentation, difficult conversation.
- **During anxiety:** Panic rising? Stop and breathe.

## The App

Counting while trying to relax is hard.

[Breathing Exercises](/apps/breathingexercises) guides you through 4-7-8 with visual cues. Just breathe along with the animation.

No counting. No thinking. Just follow the pattern.

Fall asleep faster. Wake up less. Feel calmer.
