Your body is 60% water.

Your brain is 75% water.

Every cell, every function, every thought depends on it.

Here's what happens when you don't drink enough — and why proper hydration matters more than you think.

## What Water Does in Your Body

### 1. Temperature Regulation
When you're hot, you sweat. Sweat evaporates, cooling you down.

Without adequate water, this system fails. Overheating follows.

### 2. Nutrient Transport
Blood is mostly water. Blood carries nutrients to cells.

Dehydration = thicker blood = less efficient nutrient delivery.

### 3. Waste Removal
Your kidneys filter waste through urine. Your colon needs water for regular bowel movements.

Less water = toxin buildup + constipation.

### 4. Joint Lubrication
Synovial fluid (joint lubricant) requires water.

Chronic dehydration = joint discomfort and increased wear.

### 5. Cellular Function
Every chemical reaction in your body happens in water.

Dehydrated cells function poorly.

### 6. Brain Function
Your brain floats in cerebrospinal fluid. It needs water for neurotransmitter production.

Dehydration directly impairs thinking.

## The Dehydration Cascade

Here's what happens as dehydration progresses:

### 1% Body Water Loss
- Thirst begins
- Performance starts declining
- Most people don't notice

### 2% Body Water Loss
- Cognitive impairment measurable
- Athletic performance drops 10-20%
- Mood deteriorates
- Fatigue increases

### 3% Body Water Loss
- Significant mental fog
- Coordination affected
- Headaches common
- Muscle cramps possible

### 5%+ Body Water Loss
- Severe impairment
- Medical concern
- Heat stroke risk

**The scary part:** Most people walk around at 1-2% chronically dehydrated and think it's normal.

## What Research Shows

### Cognitive Performance
A 2011 study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that 1.36% dehydration impaired:
- Concentration
- Alertness
- Short-term memory
- Mood

Participants didn't even feel thirsty yet.

### Physical Performance
Research in the Journal of Athletic Training showed:
- 2% dehydration reduces endurance by 10-20%
- Strength decreases
- Coordination suffers
- Injury risk increases

### Weight Loss
Studies show that drinking water:
- Increases metabolic rate temporarily (24-30% for 1-1.5 hours)
- Reduces appetite when consumed before meals
- Helps distinguish hunger from thirst

### Chronic Disease
Adequate hydration is associated with reduced risk of:
- Kidney stones
- Urinary tract infections
- Constipation
- Some cardiovascular events

## How Much Water Do You Need?

The "8 glasses" rule is oversimplified.

### Better calculation:
**Your weight (lbs) ÷ 2 = ounces per day**

150 lbs = 75 oz (about 2.2 liters)
200 lbs = 100 oz (about 3 liters)

### Adjust for:
- Exercise (+12-32 oz per hour of activity)
- Hot weather (+16-32 oz)
- Caffeine/alcohol (+8 oz per drink)
- Altitude
- Illness

### Signs you're drinking enough:
- Urine is light yellow (not clear, not dark)
- You're not constantly thirsty
- Good energy levels
- Regular bowel movements

## The Myth of Overhydration

Yes, you can drink too much water (hyponatremia).

But this is rare and requires extreme consumption (gallons quickly).

For most people, the risk is chronic underhydration, not overhydration.

## What Counts as Water

### Full credit:
- Plain water
- Sparkling water
- Herbal tea
- Water with fruit infusions

### Partial credit:
- Coffee (about 60-70% counts)
- Tea (caffeine is a mild diuretic)
- Milk
- Juice (counts but has calories/sugar)
- Soup/broth

### Doesn't count (or negative):
- Alcohol (net dehydrating)
- Sugary sodas (hydrating but terrible for health)

## The Timing Factor

When you drink matters.

### Morning
You wake up dehydrated. 7-8 hours without water.

**Recommendation:** 16 oz within 30 minutes of waking.

### Before meals
Water before eating reduces calorie intake and aids digestion.

**Recommendation:** 8-16 oz 30 minutes before meals.

### During exercise
Hydrate before, during, and after.

**Recommendation:** 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes during activity.

### Before bed
Drink earlier in evening. Late water = midnight bathroom trips.

**Recommendation:** Reduce intake 2 hours before bed.

## Signs of Chronic Dehydration

Many people don't realize they're dehydrated because they've always been this way.

**Check yourself:**
- Frequent headaches (especially afternoon)
- Constant fatigue
- Difficulty concentrating
- Dark urine
- Dry skin and lips
- Constipation
- Dizziness when standing
- Intense afternoon cravings (thirst mimics hunger)

## Making Hydration Automatic

### Environment design
- Water bottle always visible
- Glass on your desk
- Bottle by your bed

### Habit stacking
- Drink water after every bathroom trip
- Water before coffee
- Water with every meal

### Tracking
- Use a water tracking app
- Mark water bottle with time goals
- Simple tally on paper

[WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) automates this with smart reminders and one-tap tracking.

## FAQ

**Is cold or room temperature water better?**
Doesn't matter much for hydration. Room temp may be better for digestion.

**Can I drink too much water?**
Theoretically yes (hyponatremia), but rare. Most people drink too little.

**Does coffee dehydrate you?**
Mild diuretic effect, but you still absorb most of the water. Coffee counts partially.

**Why do I pee so much when I drink more?**
Your body adjusts. Takes 1-2 weeks. If excessive, you might be drinking too fast — spread it out.

**Is sparkling water as good as still?**
Yes, equally hydrating. The carbonation doesn't change water absorption.
