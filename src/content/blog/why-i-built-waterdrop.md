I was chronically dehydrated.

Not dramatically. Not hospitalized. Just... always a little off. Headaches at 3pm. Tired for no reason. Skin that looked like I aged ten years overnight.

I knew the fix. Drink more water. Revolutionary stuff.

But here's the thing — I'd forget. Every single day. I'd wake up with good intentions, get buried in work, and suddenly it's 7pm and I've had one cup of coffee and nothing else.

## Every water app sucked

So I downloaded a water tracker. Then another. Then five more.

They all had the same problems:

- **Annoying reminders.** Every 30 minutes like clockwork. Even when I just drank. Even when I'm in a meeting. Even when I'm sleeping.
- **Too much data.** I don't need graphs showing my hydration levels correlated with moon phases. I need to drink water.
- **Subscription models.** $4.99/month to track water? Are you serious?

I didn't need a hydration dashboard. I needed a nudge at the right time.

## So I built WaterDrop

The concept was simple:

1. Smart reminders that adapt to your schedule
2. One-tap logging
3. Streaks to keep you accountable
4. No subscription. Ever.

That's it. No social features. No gamification. No AI hydration coach.

Just the thing that actually works: a reminder when you need it, a tap when you drink, a streak that makes you not want to break it.

## The result

I've been using it for three months now.

My 3pm headaches are gone. I have more energy. My skin looks like it belongs to someone who takes care of themselves.

All because I drink water now. Groundbreaking.

WaterDrop is launching soon. If you want early access, [join the waitlist](/apps/waterdrop).
