I've been going to the gym for years.

And for years, I made the same mistakes:

- Chest and arms every session (because that's what I liked)
- Legs maybe once a month (because I "ran sometimes")
- Back when I remembered it existed
- No actual progression plan

I wasn't training. I was just... going to the gym.

## The realization

One day I looked at my workout history and noticed a pattern. I'd done chest exercises 12 times in the last month. Legs twice.

No wonder my shoulders hurt. No wonder I wasn't seeing results. I was hammering the same muscles while completely neglecting others.

I needed someone to tell me what to do next. But personal trainers are expensive, and I'm stubborn enough to think I can figure things out myself.

## So I built a coach

GymCoach AI does what a good trainer does:

1. **Tracks what you've trained.** Every workout logged, every muscle group recorded.
2. **Shows recovery status.** Visual body map showing what's fresh and what's fatigued.
3. **Suggests what's next.** Based on your history, not some generic program.

The AI part isn't gimmicky. It looks at your patterns and tells you what you're neglecting. "You haven't trained legs in 8 days." "Your back is fully recovered." "Maybe don't do chest again."

It's like having a trainer who actually pays attention.

## The muscle recovery map

This was the feature that made everything click.

A visual body map showing muscle recovery status. Green means recovered. Red means fatigued. Yellow means getting there.

Before every workout, I glance at the map. If my chest is red and my back is green, I know what to do.

No more guessing. No more overtraining. No more "I'll do legs next time."

## Progress photos that work

The app also has a progress photo feature. Same pose, same lighting, tracked over time.

Most people take progress photos randomly. Different angles, different lighting, different times of day. Then they wonder why they can't see changes.

GymCoach AI helps you take consistent photos so you can actually see the progress. Week over week. Month over month.

Sometimes the scale doesn't move but the photos tell a different story.

## Who this is for

GymCoach AI isn't for beginners who need to learn exercises. There are YouTube videos for that.

It's for people who already go to the gym but aren't seeing results. People who train hard but train dumb. People who need structure but don't want to pay $100/hour for a trainer.

It's the coach I wished I had.
