You photograph a document.

It's crooked. The lighting is uneven. Your thumb is in the corner. The text is barely readable.

You try again. And again. Eventually you give up and send something that looks unprofessional.

Your phone has a better camera than professional equipment from 10 years ago. The problem isn't the hardware.

## Scanning vs. photographing

A photo captures what's in frame.

A scan captures a document. That means:
- Detecting the edges automatically
- Correcting the perspective (even if you shot at an angle)
- Adjusting lighting for readability
- Removing shadows and fingers
- Making text crisp and searchable

Modern AI can do all of this instantly. Most people just don't have the right app.

## What makes a great scanner app

**Edge detection.** Point your camera at a document, it finds the corners automatically.

**Perspective correction.** Shoot at an angle, get a flat document.

**Lighting adjustment.** Uneven lighting becomes clean, uniform output.

**OCR.** Optical Character Recognition. Turns the image into searchable text.

**AI finger removal.** Yes, this exists. And it's magic.

## Why I built ScanSnap

I wanted scanning that felt like the future, not like using a copier.

[ScanSnap](/apps/scansnap) gives you:

- **AI edge detection** — finds document boundaries instantly
- **Automatic perspective correction** — crooked shots become straight documents
- **Handwriting OCR** — even your messy notes become searchable
- **Finger removal** — AI erases your thumb from the frame
- **Cloud export** — iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, one tap

Receipts. Business cards. Whiteboards. Contracts. Notes.

Point. Shoot. Perfect scan.

Your pocket copier just got an upgrade.
