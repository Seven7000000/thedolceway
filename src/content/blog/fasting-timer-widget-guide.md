Opening an app to check your fasting timer is 2022 behavior.

In 2026, we use widgets. One glance at your home screen — you know exactly how long you've been fasting.

Here's how to set it up.

## Why Use a Fasting Widget?

The average person checks their phone 96 times a day.

If you're fasting, you probably want to check your timer 10+ of those times. Opening an app each time? Tedious.

A widget shows:
- Hours fasted
- Time remaining
- Your current fasting zone (fat burning, autophagy, etc.)
- Visual progress ring

All without unlocking your phone or opening anything.

## iPhone: Adding a Fasting Widget

### Step 1: Get a Fasting App with Widgets

Not all fasting apps have widgets. Apps that do:
- FastTrack (multiple widget sizes)
- Zero (basic widget, premium only)
- Life Fasting (basic widget)
- Fastic (limited widget)

### Step 2: Add the Widget

1. Long-press on your home screen (hold until icons wiggle)
2. Tap the **+** in the top-left corner
3. Search for your fasting app
4. Choose widget size:
   - **Small** — shows timer only
   - **Medium** — timer + zone
   - **Large** — timer + zone + progress ring
5. Tap "Add Widget"
6. Position it where you want
7. Tap "Done"

### Step 3: Configure (If Available)

Long-press the widget → "Edit Widget" to customize what it shows.

## Android: Adding a Fasting Widget

### Step 1: Get a Compatible App

Most fasting apps support Android widgets:
- FastTrack
- Zero
- Fastic
- Life Fasting

### Step 2: Add the Widget

1. Long-press on empty home screen space
2. Tap "Widgets"
3. Find your fasting app
4. Hold and drag the widget to your home screen
5. Resize if needed

## Best Widget Sizes

**Small widget** — Good if you just want the time. Minimal info, minimal space.

**Medium widget** — The sweet spot. Shows timer + current zone + progress.

**Large widget** — Maximum info. Timer, zone, percentage, streak. Takes up significant space.

My recommendation: Medium. You see what matters without sacrificing half your home screen.

## What Makes a Good Fasting Widget?

### Essential:
- **Live updates** — Shows current time, not last time you opened the app
- **Fasting zone** — Tells you if you're in fat burning, ketosis, or autophagy
- **Progress visual** — Ring or bar showing how far along you are

### Nice to have:
- Start/stop button on widget
- Streak counter
- Eating window countdown

### Red flags:
- Widget that requires opening the app to update
- Premium-only widget
- Widget that drains battery

## Lock Screen Widget (iOS 16+)

iPhone users can add fasting widgets to the lock screen:

1. Long-press on lock screen
2. Tap "Customize"
3. Select the lock screen
4. Tap the widget area below the time
5. Add your fasting app widget
6. Done

Now you see your fast without even unlocking your phone.

## Fasting Widget vs. Notification

Some apps use notifications instead of widgets to show progress.

**Widget pros:**
- Always visible
- No notification center clutter
- Updates in real-time
- Looks cleaner

**Notification pros:**
- Works on older devices
- No home screen setup
- Can include action buttons

Verdict: Widget is better if your phone supports it.

## Troubleshooting

### Widget not updating?

1. Make sure the app is running in the background
2. Check app permissions (Background App Refresh on iPhone)
3. Remove and re-add the widget
4. Restart your phone

### Widget showing wrong time?

The app might have lost track of your fast. Open the app to re-sync.

### Widget not available?

Update the app. Widget support is often added in newer versions.

## My Widget Setup

I keep a medium FastTrack widget in the top-left of my home screen.

At a glance I see:
- "14h 32m" (time fasted)
- "Fat Burning 🔥" (current zone)
- Progress ring (87% complete)

When my eating window opens, the widget changes to show time remaining in my eating window.

No opening apps. No checking. Just a glance.

## FAQ

**Do fasting widgets drain battery?**
Minimal. They update every few minutes, not constantly.

**Can I start/stop a fast from the widget?**
Some widgets have buttons for this. FastTrack does.

**Why isn't my widget showing on iPhone?**
Make sure you added it correctly (long-press → +). Check that the app supports widgets.

**Is there a fasting widget for Apple Watch?**
Yes. Most fasting apps have Watch complications that work similarly.
