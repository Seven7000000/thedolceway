Intermittent fasting isn't a diet. It's a schedule.

You're not changing what you eat. You're changing when you eat.

This guide covers everything — from the science to the practice.

## What Is Intermittent Fasting?

Intermittent fasting (IF) cycles between periods of eating and not eating.

You already do this. It's called sleeping.

IF extends that natural fast.

**Common protocols:**
- **16:8** — Fast 16 hours, eat in 8-hour window
- **18:6** — Fast 18 hours, eat in 6-hour window
- **20:4** — Fast 20 hours, eat in 4-hour window
- **OMAD** — One meal a day
- **5:2** — Eat normally 5 days, restrict calories 2 days

## The Science: Why Fasting Works

### 1. Insulin Drops
When you eat, insulin rises. Insulin tells your body to store fat.

When you fast, insulin drops. Your body can access stored fat for energy.

**Translation:** Lower insulin = easier fat burning.

### 2. Growth Hormone Increases
During fasting, human growth hormone (HGH) increases up to 5x.

HGH helps preserve muscle mass while burning fat.

### 3. Cellular Repair (Autophagy)
After 16-24 hours of fasting, your cells start cleaning house.

Autophagy = cells breaking down and recycling damaged components.

This is linked to longevity and disease prevention.

### 4. Gene Expression
Fasting changes gene expression related to longevity and disease protection.

### 5. Calorie Reduction (Usually)
A smaller eating window usually means fewer calories.

Not always — you can out-eat your fast — but most people naturally eat less.

## The Different Fasting Methods

### 16:8 (Most Popular)
**Fast:** 16 hours
**Eat:** 8 hours

**Example:** Last meal at 8pm, first meal at 12pm (noon).

**Best for:** Beginners, sustainable long-term.

### 18:6
**Fast:** 18 hours
**Eat:** 6 hours

**Example:** Last meal at 6pm, first meal at 12pm.

**Best for:** Intermediate fasters wanting more benefits.

### 20:4 (Warrior Diet)
**Fast:** 20 hours
**Eat:** 4 hours

**Example:** One large meal and small snack.

**Best for:** Advanced fasters, those who prefer bigger meals.

### OMAD (One Meal a Day)
**Fast:** ~23 hours
**Eat:** 1 meal

**Best for:** Aggressive fat loss, experienced fasters.

### 5:2
**Normal:** 5 days per week
**Restricted:** 2 days (500-600 calories)

**Best for:** People who don't want daily restriction.

### Alternate Day Fasting
**Fast:** Every other day
**Eat:** Normal days

**Best for:** Aggressive protocols, not beginners.

## How to Start Intermittent Fasting

### Week 1: Ease In
Don't jump to 16 hours immediately.

**Days 1-3:** 12-hour fast (8pm to 8am)
**Days 4-5:** 14-hour fast (8pm to 10am)
**Days 6-7:** 16-hour fast (8pm to 12pm)

### Week 2-4: Build the Habit
- Same eating window daily
- Track your fasts
- Note how you feel

### Month 2+: Optimize
- Adjust window based on your life
- Experiment with longer fasts occasionally
- Find what's sustainable

## What Breaks a Fast?

**Won't break your fast:**
- Water (drink lots)
- Black coffee
- Plain tea
- Sparkling water

**Will break your fast:**
- Food (obviously)
- Milk/cream in coffee
- Diet sodas (controversial, but may spike insulin)
- BCAAs
- Most supplements (check labels)

**Gray area:**
- Bulletproof coffee (technically breaks fast, some people do it anyway)
- Bone broth (minimal calories)

## What to Eat During Your Window

Fasting doesn't give you a free pass to eat garbage.

**Prioritize:**
- Protein (keeps you full, preserves muscle)
- Vegetables (nutrients, fiber)
- Healthy fats (satiation)
- Complex carbs (energy)

**Minimize:**
- Processed foods
- Sugar
- Empty calories

**Breaking your fast:** Start with protein and vegetables, not sugar. Prevents blood sugar spikes.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Starting too aggressively
Going from eating 18 hours a day to 4 hours? You'll crash.

**Fix:** Ease in gradually.

### 2. Not drinking enough water
Hunger is often thirst.

**Fix:** Drink more water than you think you need.

### 3. Eating too little during window
Some people under-eat and crash.

**Fix:** Get enough calories. Fasting ≠ extreme restriction.

### 4. Overeating during window
A 4-hour window doesn't mean 4 hours of eating.

**Fix:** Eat normal meals, just compressed.

### 5. Ignoring quality
Junk food in a 4-hour window is still junk food.

**Fix:** Prioritize whole foods.

### 6. Not tracking
You think you're fasting 16 hours. You're actually doing 13.

**Fix:** Use a [fasting tracker](/apps/fasttrack).

## Who Should NOT Fast

**Consult a doctor first if you:**
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Have diabetes (especially Type 1)
- Have a history of eating disorders
- Are underweight
- Take medications requiring food
- Have other health conditions

**Fasting isn't for everyone.** When in doubt, ask a professional.

## What to Expect

### Week 1
- Hunger (especially mid-morning)
- Headaches (drink more water)
- Irritability
- Questioning if this is worth it

### Week 2-3
- Hunger decreases
- Mental clarity improves
- Energy stabilizes
- Getting easier

### Month 1+
- Fasting feels natural
- Body composition changes starting
- Cognitive benefits noticeable
- "Why didn't I start earlier?"

## Fasting and Exercise

### Working out fasted:
- Fine for most people
- Some prefer it (mental clarity)
- May feel weaker at first
- Performance adapts

### Working out fed:
- Better for intense sessions
- Time your eating window before workout
- Protein after workout for recovery

**My recommendation:** Experiment. Some people thrive fasted, others don't.

## Tracking Your Fasts

Track to stay consistent.

[FastTrack](/apps/fasttrack) shows:
- Current fast duration
- Fasting zones (fat burning, autophagy)
- History and streaks
- When to start/stop

It removes the guesswork.

## FAQ

**How much weight will I lose?**
Depends on your overall calories. Typical: 0.5-2 lbs/week.

**Can I drink coffee?**
Yes, black. Cream/sugar breaks the fast.

**Will I lose muscle?**
No, if you eat enough protein and continue training. HGH increase actually helps preserve muscle.

**How long until I see results?**
Energy: 1-2 weeks. Body composition: 4-8 weeks.

**Can I fast every day?**
Yes. Many people do 16:8 daily, indefinitely.

**Is breakfast really that important?**
No. "Breakfast is the most important meal" is marketing, not science.

**Can I have cheat days?**
Yes. Occasional breaks are fine. Consistency matters more than perfection.
