You're cooking.

Recipe says 500ml of water. Your measuring cup is in cups.

You grab your phone. Open Safari. Type "500ml in cups." Wait for the page to load. Scroll past ads. Find the answer.

2.11 cups.

Total time: 30 seconds of context switching for something that should take 1 second.

## You do this constantly

Conversions happen all the time:

- Cooking: ml to cups, grams to ounces, Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Travel: miles to kilometers, dollars to euros, Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Fitness: pounds to kilograms, miles to kilometers
- Work: whatever units your international colleagues use

Every time you Google it, you lose focus. The information should be instant.

## Why existing converters suck

I tried the apps. Problems:

**Too complicated.** 47 unit categories I'll never use. Where's the one I need?

**Too ugly.** Interfaces designed in 2008. Hard to use quickly.

**Ad-infested.** Convert a unit, watch an ad. No thanks.

**Require internet.** What if I'm cooking and my hands are covered in flour?

## So I built Convertly

[Convertly](/apps/convertly) does conversions right:

- **13 categories** — length, weight, temperature, volume, cooking, more
- **Instant results** — type a number, see the conversion
- **Favorites** — save conversions you use often
- **Works offline** — no internet needed
- **Clean design** — find what you need in seconds

No ads. No subscription. No bloat.

The conversion you need, the moment you need it.

Stop Googling. Start cooking.
