You've heard of white noise.

But have you heard of brown noise? Pink noise?

They're all different. And they're good for different things.

Let me break it down.

## What Is Colored Noise?

"Noise" in this context means random sound across frequencies.

The "color" describes which frequencies are emphasized.

Think of it like light: white light contains all colors. But you can filter to get specific colors. Same with sound.

## White Noise

**Sound:** Static. TV with no signal. Hissing rain.

**Technical:** Equal intensity across all frequencies. A flat frequency spectrum.

**Best for:** Blocking external noise. Office environments. Masking conversations.

**For sleep?** Works for many people. Can be harsh for others.

The high frequencies in white noise can feel "sharp" or fatiguing to some ears. If white noise feels too intense, try pink or brown.

## Pink Noise

**Sound:** Softer than white. Steady rainfall. Wind through trees. Heartbeat.

**Technical:** Lower frequencies are louder. Power decreases as frequency increases.

**Best for:** Sleep. Studying. Background ambiance.

**For sleep?** Studies show pink noise may improve deep sleep. It's closer to natural sounds, so your brain may find it more calming.

Many people prefer pink noise over white noise for sleeping.

## Brown Noise (Brownian Noise)

**Sound:** Deep, rumbling. Thunder. Waterfall. Strong wind.

**Technical:** Even more bass-heavy than pink. Power decreases faster at higher frequencies.

**Best for:** Deep focus. Blocking out distractions. ADHD concentration.

**For sleep?** Excellent for people who like "cozy" or "enveloping" sounds. The heaviness can feel like a sound blanket.

Recently went viral for helping people with ADHD focus. The low frequencies may be less stimulating to active brains.

## The Comparison

| Noise | Sound Profile | Best For | Frequency |
|-------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| White | Hissy, sharp | Masking noise | Flat |
| Pink | Balanced, natural | Sleep, study | Medium bass |
| Brown | Deep, rumbling | Focus, ADHD | Heavy bass |

## Which Should You Try?

### Start with pink noise if:
- You want better sleep
- White noise feels harsh
- You like natural sounds

### Start with brown noise if:
- You need deep focus
- You have ADHD or racing thoughts
- You like thunderstorms and waterfalls
- You want to feel "cocooned"

### Stick with white noise if:
- You're in a loud environment
- You need to mask specific sounds (conversations, traffic)
- It already works for you

## The Test

Don't overthink it. Try each for one night.

You'll know within 10 minutes which one your brain prefers. Trust the feeling.
