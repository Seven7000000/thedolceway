Some people look effortlessly put together.

Same clothes you'd wear. Same basic style.

But somehow they look... better. More expensive. More polished.

The secret? They're wearing their colors.

## The Problem

You buy a sweater that looked amazing in the store.

You wear it. Something feels off. You look tired. Washed out. The garment looks cheap even though it wasn't.

It's probably the color.

Wrong colors make your skin look dull, highlight dark circles, and make you appear less healthy.

Right colors make your skin glow, eyes pop, and overall appearance seem more vibrant.

## Color Season Theory

The system that explains this is called seasonal color analysis.

Based on your skin's undertone, hair color, and contrast level, you fall into one of four seasonal palettes:

### Spring (Warm + Light)
Golden undertones. Light hair or warm browns. Often freckles.

**Best colors:** Warm, bright, light. Coral, peach, warm greens, golden yellows.

**Avoid:** Cool, muted colors. Gray, burgundy, icy tones.

### Summer (Cool + Light)
Pinkish or neutral undertones. Ashy hair. Lower contrast.

**Best colors:** Cool, soft, muted. Lavender, dusty rose, soft blues, cool grays.

**Avoid:** Warm, intense colors. Orange, mustard, bright tomato red.

### Autumn (Warm + Deep)
Golden or olive undertones. Warm hair tones. Medium to high contrast.

**Best colors:** Warm, rich, muted. Olive, burnt orange, terracotta, deep teal.

**Avoid:** Cool, bright colors. Hot pink, icy blue, black (can be too harsh).

### Winter (Cool + Deep)
Cool undertones. High contrast (dark hair, light skin, or very dark skin). Clear features.

**Best colors:** Cool, bold, clear. True red, royal blue, pure white, black, emerald.

**Avoid:** Warm, muted colors. Mustard, camel, earthy tones.

## How to Find Your Season

### Quick test: Gold vs Silver
Hold gold jewelry and silver jewelry next to your face.

Which makes you look brighter? More alive?

Gold = Warm (Spring or Autumn)
Silver = Cool (Summer or Winter)

### Next: High contrast vs Low contrast
Do you have high contrast (dark hair, light skin) or low contrast (features blend together)?

High contrast = Winter or Autumn
Low contrast = Summer or Spring

### The Combinations

- Warm + Light = Spring
- Cool + Light = Summer
- Warm + Deep = Autumn
- Cool + Deep = Winter

## The Transformation

When I started wearing my colors:

- People asked if I'd been on vacation (I hadn't)
- Compliments shifted from "nice shirt" to "you look great"
- Photos improved without changing anything else
- I stopped buying things that "looked good in store" but never worn

It's subtle but compound. Every piece in the right color adds up.

## Building a Wardrobe

Once you know your season:

1. **Audit your closet.** Everything in a wrong color? Donate or sell.
2. **Buy basics in your colors.** Neutral palette first.
3. **Add accent pieces.** Your best statement colors.
4. **Check before buying.** Is this in my palette?

Over time, everything matches. Everything looks intentional. Everything flatters.

## The App

I built [Dresscode](/apps/dresscode) to make this easier.

Discover your seasonal color palette. See your recommended colors. Shop smarter.

Stop buying clothes that look wrong on you.
