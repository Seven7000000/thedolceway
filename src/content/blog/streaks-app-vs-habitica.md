Streaks is minimal. Habitica is an RPG. And there's everything in between.

Which habit tracking approach actually works?

## The Three Philosophies

### Minimalist (Streaks)
Track habits. See streaks. That's it.

### Gamified (Habitica)
Level up your character. Fight monsters. Join guilds.

### Middle ground (SimpleStreaks, Productive)
More than a list. Less than a game.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Streaks | Habitica | SimpleStreaks |
|---------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Price | $5 | Free | Free |
| Platform | iOS | All | iOS |
| Gamification | None | Full RPG | Minimal |
| Habit limit | 12 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Social | No | Yes (guilds) | No |
| Complexity | Low | High | Low |
| Apple Watch | Yes | Limited | Yes |

## Which Philosophy Works Best?

### Research says:
- Gamification works **short-term** for motivation
- Simplicity works **long-term** for sustainability
- Social accountability helps **some** people, annoys others

### The pattern I've observed:
1. People try Habitica, love it for 2-3 months, abandon it
2. People buy Streaks, use it for years
3. People use simple free apps consistently

**Translation:** Start simple. Add gamification only if you genuinely enjoy it.

## Who Should Use What

### Use Streaks if:
- You're an Apple user
- You want premium quality
- You prefer minimal design
- $5 isn't an issue
- You have <12 core habits

### Use Habitica if:
- You love games/RPGs
- You want social features
- You're competitive
- You have lots of habits/tasks
- You need heavy motivation

### Use SimpleStreaks if:
- You want free and simple
- Gamification isn't your thing
- You have more than 12 habits
- You want streaks without complexity

## The Habit App Graveyard

A warning: Most people download habit apps enthusiastically, use them for weeks, then stop.

**Why:**
- Too many habits at once
- App complexity creates friction
- Novelty wears off
- Life gets in the way

**Prevention:**
- Start with 1-3 habits max
- Use the simplest app that works
- Focus on the habit, not the app
- If Habitica gets boring, switch to simple

## My Recommendation

**For most people:** SimpleStreaks or Streaks

Habit tracking should be frictionless. Complex apps become another thing to manage.

**For gamification lovers:** Try Habitica

Some people genuinely maintain motivation through game mechanics. Know yourself.

**For serious Apple users:** Streaks ($5)

Best integration, best design, reasonable one-time cost.
