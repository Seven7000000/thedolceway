MyFitnessPal used to be great.

Now it's bloated, expensive, and full of features you don't need.

You want to track calories. Here are apps that do that without the noise.

## Why People Are Leaving MyFitnessPal

1. **Premium lock-out** — Macros, bar code scans without limits, and more require $80/year
2. **Cluttered interface** — Features everywhere, hard to find what you need
3. **Ads** — Free version is full of them
4. **Complexity** — It's trying to be everything instead of doing one thing well
5. **Inaccurate database** — User-submitted data is often wrong

You just want to log food. You shouldn't need a PhD.

## CalorieCalculator: Quick Estimates

Sometimes you don't need an app — just a quick calculation.

[CalorieCalculator](/apps/caloriecalculator) calculates your TDEE (calories to maintain weight) and suggests targets for loss/gain.

Use it once to get your numbers, then track with a simple app.

## What MyFitnessPal Does Better

To be fair, MFP still wins in some areas:

- **Largest database** — More foods than anywhere else
- **Recipe import** — Import recipes from URLs
- **Social features** — Large friend community
- **Integrations** — Connects to everything

If these matter to you, MFP might still be worth the frustration.

## My Recommendation

**For most people:** Lose It
Clean, simple, does the job.

**For accuracy obsessives:** Cronometer
Verified data, micronutrient tracking.

**For smart coaching:** MacroFactor
Worth $72/year if you want the app to think for you.

**For free:** FatSecret
Gets the job done without premium.

**For Europeans:** Yazio
Better database for European foods.

## Do You Even Need to Track Calories?

Tracking works for:
- Losing weight with precision
- Gaining muscle without getting fat
- Understanding what you're actually eating
- Building awareness before intuitive eating

Tracking might not be for you if:
- You have history of disordered eating
- It creates anxiety
- You have good intuition about portions
- You're maintaining, not changing

If you're unsure, try tracking for 2 weeks. You'll quickly know if it helps.

## FAQ

**Is MyFitnessPal still the best?**
No. It was. Now there are better options for most use cases.

**Is premium worth it for any of these apps?**
Cronometer Gold and MacroFactor are worth it for serious users. Others, debatable.

**Which has the best barcode scanner?**
Lose It and MFP are both excellent. Cronometer is good but smaller database.

**Can I import my MFP data to other apps?**
Most apps don't support MFP imports. You'll start fresh.

**What about tracking without an app?**
Paper journals, spreadsheets, or even photos of meals work for some people.
