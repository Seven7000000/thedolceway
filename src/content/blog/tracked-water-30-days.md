I drink a lot of water.

At least, I thought I did.

Then I actually tracked it for 30 days. The results were embarrassing.

## The Setup

Simple experiment:
- Track every glass of water for 30 days
- Target: 3 liters per day (about 100oz)
- Log it immediately — no "I'll remember later"

I used a prototype of [WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) because every other app was either too complicated or too annoying.

## Week 1: Reality Check

**Average daily intake: 1.4 liters**

That's less than half my target. And I genuinely believed I was "pretty good" about hydration.

The problem? I'd drink coffee in the morning, maybe one glass of water at lunch, and then nothing until dinner.

By 3pm, I was in a constant state of mild dehydration. No wonder I felt foggy every afternoon.

## Week 2: Building the Habit

I set reminders every 2 hours.

Not aggressive "DRINK WATER NOW" notifications. Just gentle nudges that said "It's been a while."

**Average daily intake: 2.1 liters**

Getting better. But what surprised me: I wasn't drinking more water, I was just drinking more consistently.

## Week 3: The Shift

Something clicked.

I started actually feeling thirsty again. My body's thirst signals, which had been broken for years, started working again.

**Average daily intake: 2.7 liters**

I stopped needing reminders by afternoon. I'd just... want water.

## Week 4: Results

**Average daily intake: 3.1 liters**

But more importantly:

- Afternoon energy crashes: Gone
- Headaches: Way less frequent
- Skin: Noticeably clearer
- Sleep: Slightly better (didn't expect this)

## The Numbers

| Week | Average Intake | Energy Level (1-10) | Headache Days |
|------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1 | 1.4L | 5 | 4 |
| 2 | 2.1L | 6 | 2 |
| 3 | 2.7L | 7 | 1 |
| 4 | 3.1L | 8 | 0 |

## What I Learned

**1. You're probably dehydrated right now.**
Most people are. You've just normalized how it feels.

**2. Tracking beats intention.**
"I'll drink more water" means nothing. Seeing "1.4L" when you expected 3L? That's motivation.

**3. Your thirst signals are broken.**
If you're chronically underhydrated, you lose the ability to feel proper thirst. It comes back after a few weeks of consistent hydration.

**4. Consistency > volume.**
Chugging a liter at night doesn't undo a day of dehydration. Small amounts throughout the day is the answer.

## Try It Yourself

You don't need to do 30 days. Try 7.

Just track every glass. Don't judge. Don't try to hit a specific target. Just observe.

You'll be surprised what you learn.

[WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) makes it one tap to log. Reminders that don't annoy. Progress you can actually see.
