Most people have ideas.

I have apps. 22 of them.

Built solo. Ready to deploy. Apple approval pending.

This isn't luck. This is a system.

## Why 22 Apps?

Because I've done this before.

Built a company to $750K revenue. $4M valuation. From nothing.

That taught me something: execution beats ideas. Every time.

So when I decided to build again, I didn't start with one app and "see how it goes."

I built 22.

## What's The System?

There's a method to this.

I won't give it all away here — that's for later — but here's what I'll say:

- Speed over perfection
- Systems over motivation
- Shipping over planning

Most people spend months on one app. I shipped 22 in weeks.

Not because I'm special. Because I have a process.

## Why Build in Public?

Because someone needs to see this.

Not the highlight reel. Not the "I made $10K MRR" screenshot with no context.

The real journey. From zero. With receipts.

If I can build 22 apps solo, you can build one.

If I can come back after building a $4M company, you can start wherever you are.

This isn't about me. It's about showing what's possible.

## What's Next

The apps go live. One by one.

Every launch documented. Every number shared. Every lesson learned.

You're here before the App Store charts. Before the revenue screenshots. Before the case studies.

Ground floor.

Remember this moment.

## Follow Along

This is just the beginning.

I'm documenting everything — the wins, the lessons, the real numbers.

Not to flex. To show you the path.

Your move.
