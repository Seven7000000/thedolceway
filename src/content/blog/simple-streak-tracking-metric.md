Most habit trackers have 47 features you'll never use.

You need one thing: a streak counter.

Here's why it's the only metric that matters.

## What Is Streak Tracking?

You do something. You mark it done. The number goes up.

Day 1. Day 2. Day 7. Day 30. Day 100.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

Simple? Yes. Effective? Extremely.

## Why Streaks Work

### 1. Loss Aversion

Losing something hurts twice as much as gaining something feels good.

At Day 1, there's nothing to lose. At Day 50, breaking the streak feels like losing 50 days of work.

The streak becomes an asset you don't want to lose.

### 2. Compound Visibility

On Day 1, you can't see progress.

On Day 30, the number proves you've been consistent for a month.

That visual evidence builds confidence. "I can do this. I have been doing this."

### 3. Identity Building

Around Day 60-90, something shifts.

You're no longer "trying to meditate." You're "someone who meditates."

The streak is evidence of who you are.

### 4. Momentum

A streak in motion tends to stay in motion.

Skipping feels increasingly unacceptable as the number grows.

## What to Track (And What Not To)

### Track things that are:
- **Binary** — You either did it or didn't. No gray area.
- **Daily** — Or at least frequent enough to build momentum.
- **Important** — Worth tracking, worth doing consistently.

**Good streak habits:**
- Meditated (yes/no)
- Drank 8 glasses of water (yes/no)
- Exercised (yes/no)
- Read (yes/no)
- No alcohol (yes/no)

### Don't track:
- **Goals with numbers** — "Run 5 miles" is a target, not a streak
- **Weekly things** — Lose the daily momentum
- **Everything** — Pick 1-3 habits max

## The Perfect Streak System

### 1. Keep it visible
Check it every day. Widget on home screen. Paper on the fridge. Whatever works.

### 2. Make it easy to check
One tap to mark done. Not 4 screens and a confirmation.

### 3. Check at the same time
End of day review. Morning check-in. Consistency in tracking helps consistency in doing.

### 4. Start one habit at a time
Don't start 5 streaks at once. Start one. Build it to 30 days. Then add another.

## The Psychology of Streak Numbers

Different numbers hit different:

**Day 7:** "Okay, one week down."
**Day 14:** "Two weeks. Starting to feel real."
**Day 21:** "The supposed habit formation mark. Feels easier."
**Day 30:** "One month. I can do this."
**Day 50:** "Haven't thought about skipping in a while."
**Day 100:** "This is just what I do now."
**Day 365:** "This is who I am."

The magic happens somewhere between 30 and 90. Push through the first month.

## When You Break a Streak

It will happen. Here's what to do:

### 1. Don't catastrophize
One miss doesn't undo 50 days of work. The neural pathways are still there.

### 2. Restart immediately
Day 1 again. Don't wallow. Don't wait for Monday.

### 3. Learn from it
Why did you miss? Environment? Stress? Travel? Fix it.

### 4. Never miss twice
Once is a stumble. Twice is a new habit.

## Streaks vs Other Metrics

### Streaks vs completion rate
"I completed my habit 85% of days this month" isn't as motivating as "I'm on a 26-day streak."

Streaks provide emotional weight. Percentages are just numbers.

### Streaks vs time-based goals
"I want to meditate for 100 hours" is hard to visualize.

"I've meditated 100 days in a row" is concrete.

### Streaks vs habit scores
Some apps calculate "habit scores" based on multiple factors.

Complicated. Gameable. Less effective than simple streaks.

## Building Your First Streak

### Step 1: Pick one habit
Not your hardest habit. Not your most important. Pick one you're confident you can do daily.

### Step 2: Make it tiny
Two minutes. Something you can do even on your worst day.

### Step 3: Get a tracker
[SimpleStreaks](/apps/simplestreaks), paper calendar, whatever. Make the number visible.

### Step 4: Check daily
Same time each day. Build the tracking habit.

### Step 5: Protect the streak
Once you hit 7 days, you'll feel the pull. Use it.

## FAQ

**How many habits should I track?**
1-3 max. More than that, you'll track none.

**What if I miss a day for a good reason?**
That's life. Reset and go. Don't create exceptions that become rules.

**Is a streak really better than just being consistent?**
Psychologically, yes. The number creates emotional investment that "being consistent" doesn't.

**Should I track habits I'm already good at?**
No. Track habits you need to build. Tracking existing habits is just checking boxes.

**What's the longest streak you should aim for?**
Don't set a target. Just don't break it. Forever is fine.
