Your phone camera can scan documents. Free.

So why do scanner apps charge $5, $10, even subscriptions?

Let's see what you're actually paying for.

## Free Options

### Apple Notes (iPhone)
- Built into iOS
- Basic scanning

## What Free Scanners Lack

1. **Advanced editing** — Crop, rotate, reorder pages

3. **Batch processing** — Scanning many documents fast
4. **Annotations** — Signatures, highlights, text
5. **File organization** — Folders, search, tags
6. **Offline capability** — Some require internet
7. **No ads** — Free often means ads

## Feature Comparison

## The Quality Question

Does a $10 app really scan better than free?

**Scan quality:** Mostly the same. Your camera hardware matters more.

**Edge detection:** Premium apps are slightly better at finding edges.

**OCR accuracy:** Paid apps have noticeably better text recognition.

**Overall:** For occasional scanning, free is fine. For frequent use, premium features matter.

## When Free Is Enough

✅ **Use free if you:**
- Scan a few documents per month
- Don't need OCR
- Only need basic PDF export
- Are fine with limited organization

## When Premium Is Worth It

✅ **Consider premium if you:**
- Scan documents regularly
- Need OCR (searchable text)
- Sign/annotate documents
- Want organized document storage
- Scan receipts for expenses
- Work with multi-page documents often

## The Privacy Question

Scanner apps handle sensitive documents.

**Questions to ask:**
- Does the app upload to their servers?
- Is OCR processed locally or in cloud?
- What's their data retention policy?

**Safest options:**
- Apple Notes (on-device)
- [ScanSnap](/apps/scansnap) (on-device processing)
- Scanner Pro (configurable)

## My Recommendation

**For most people:** Start with Apple Notes or Google Drive

See if you actually need more features.

**For regular scanning:** [ScanSnap](/apps/scansnap) (free)

Full features without subscription.

**For power users:** Scanner Pro ($10 one-time)

Worth the investment if you scan a lot.

**Avoid:** Subscription scanner apps

Paying monthly for a scanner doesn't make sense unless you're a business.

## FAQ

**Is a scanner app better than phone camera?**
Yes. Auto-cropping, perspective correction, and PDF creation make a difference.

If you ever search your documents or copy text from them, yes.

Rarely. One-time purchase apps have the same features.
