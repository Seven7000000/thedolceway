Calm is a great app. It's also $70 a year.

That's a lot for guided breathing and sleep stories.

Here are alternatives that cost less (or nothing) and work just as well.

## What Calm Actually Offers

Before finding alternatives, let's be clear what we're replacing:

- **Guided meditations** (hundreds of them)
- **Sleep stories** (celebrity narrated)
- **Breathing exercises**
- **Daily calm** (new content daily)
- **Masterclasses** (extended programs)
- **Music/soundscapes**

The question: Do you actually use all of this?

Most people use 2-3 features. No need to pay for everything.

## The Best Free Alternatives

### 1. MeditationApp

**Price:** Free

I built this because I wanted Calm's core features without the bloat.

**What you don't get:**

## Cheaper Premium Alternatives

If free isn't quite enough:

### Headspace ($70/year or $13/month)

**Same price as Calm, different style:**

**Choose Headspace over Calm if:** You prefer structure and programs over browsing content.

### Balance (Free first year)

**What you get:**

**The catch:** $70/year after the free year

**Choose Balance if:** You want personalization and will actually use it for a year.

### Ten Percent Happier ($100/year)

**What you get:**
- Dan Harris's skeptical approach
- Real teacher access
- High-quality teachers

**Choose this if:** You're skeptical about meditation and want a logical approach.

## Features You Actually Need

Be honest about what you use:

| Feature | Do you use it? | Free alternative |
|---------|---------------|------------------|
| Guided meditation | Probably | All free apps |
| Sleep stories | Maybe | YouTube, podcasts |
| Breathing exercises | Yes | BreathingExercises app |
| Daily content | Rarely | Not needed |
| Courses | Once | Free YouTube programs |

Most people need: meditation + breathing + maybe sleep sounds.

You don't need 50,000 sessions.

## The Sleep Story Alternative

Calm's sleep stories are genuinely good. But they're not unique.

**Free alternatives:**
- YouTube: "Sleep Story" (thousands available)
- Podcasts: "Sleep With Me," "Nothing Much Happens"
- [WhiteNoise](/apps/whitenoise): Sleep sounds without stories

The celebrity factor is nice but not necessary for falling asleep.

## My Recommendation

**If you've never meditated:**
Start with [MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp) (free). See if you stick with it.

**If you want variety:**
Use Insight Timer (free). Endless content.

**If you want structure:**
Try Headspace or Balance's free year.

**If you've outgrown free apps:**
Calm is legitimately good. Just wait for a sale ($40/year on Black Friday).

## FAQ

**Is Calm worth $70/year?**
If you use it daily, yes. If you use it weekly, probably not.

**What's the best completely free meditation app?**
Insight Timer for variety. MeditationApp for simplicity. Smiling Mind for families.

**Can I get Calm's sleep stories for free?**

MeditationApp and Smiling Mind: No ads. Insight Timer: Some promotion for premium.
