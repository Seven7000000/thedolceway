Fasting is simple. Don't eat. Then eat.

So why does every fasting app act like you're preparing for a Mars mission?

I tried them all. Here's the truth nobody's telling you.

## Zero

The "gold standard." Clean design. Science-backed.

Also: constantly upselling premium. Bloated with content you'll never read. The free version feels like a demo.

**Verdict:** Good app buried under monetization.

## Fastic

Nice UI. Good onboarding.

But holy shit the upselling. Every. Single. Tap. "Go premium!" "Unlock this!" "Upgrade now!"

Let me fast in peace.

**Verdict:** Would be great if they weren't so desperate for your money.

## Life Fasting

Completely free. No upsells.

The UI looks like it was designed in 2015. Social features nobody asked for. Hasn't been updated in years.

**Verdict:** Best free option if you can stomach the design.

## Simple

Personalized plans. Meal tracking. Guidance everywhere.

Bro. It's a diet app that happens to have a fasting timer. Way too much going on.

**Verdict:** If you need hand-holding, fine. If you just want to fast, overkill.

## The Problem

These apps make money by making fasting seem complicated.

"Metabolic states." "Autophagy zones." "Fat burning windows."

So you feel like you NEED their premium tier to understand what's happening in your body.

Here's what's actually happening: You're not eating. That's it.

## What You Actually Need

1. A timer
2. A way to track streaks
3. Nothing else

That's why I built FastTrack.

## FastTrack

One tap to start. Popular protocols built in (16:8, 18:6, 20:4, OMAD). Streaks that keep you accountable.

No "metabolic science." No premium upsells. No graphs you'll never look at.

Just a timer and a streak.
