Navy SEALs use this breathing technique before operations.

If it works for them before combat, it'll work for you before a meeting.

## What Is Box Breathing?

Box breathing (also called four-square breathing) is a controlled breathing pattern.

**The pattern:**
1. Inhale for 4 seconds
2. Hold for 4 seconds
3. Exhale for 4 seconds
4. Hold for 4 seconds
5. Repeat

That's it. Simple but powerful.

## Why It's Called Box Breathing

The four equal parts form a square:

```
    Inhale (4s)
    ──────────►
    │         │
Hold│         │Hold
(4s)│         │(4s)
    │         │
    ◄──────────
    Exhale (4s)
```

Visual learners often find this helpful.

## Why It Works

### 1. Activates parasympathetic nervous system
The breath holds stimulate the vagus nerve.

This triggers your "rest and digest" response, counteracting "fight or flight."

### 2. Increases CO2 tolerance
The holds create mild CO2 buildup.

This has a natural calming effect.

### 3. Forces focus
Counting and timing requires attention.

Your mind can't race if it's focused on counting.

### 4. Breaks stress patterns
When stressed, breathing becomes shallow and fast.

Box breathing interrupts this pattern.

## How to Do Box Breathing (Step by Step)

### Setup:
1. Sit comfortably, spine straight
2. Relax your shoulders
3. Close eyes (optional but helps)
4. Breathe out completely to start fresh

### The practice:

**Inhale (4 seconds)**
- Breathe in through nose
- Fill lungs completely
- Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

**Hold (4 seconds)**
- Keep air in
- Don't tense up
- Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

**Exhale (4 seconds)**
- Breathe out through mouth (or nose)
- Empty lungs completely
- Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

**Hold (4 seconds)**
- Lungs empty
- Stay relaxed
- Count: 1... 2... 3... 4...

**Repeat for 4-8 cycles.**

## When to Use Box Breathing

### Acute stress
- Before a presentation
- During an argument
- When you feel panic rising
- After receiving bad news

### Daily practice
- Morning routine
- Before bed
- Meditation warm-up

### Performance situations
- Before athletic competition
- Pre-exam
- Important meetings
- Job interviews

### Anytime you notice stress
The more you practice, the faster it works.

## How Long to Practice

### Minimum effective dose:
4 cycles (about 1 minute)

### Standard practice:
4-8 cycles (2-4 minutes)

### Deep relaxation:
10-20 cycles (5-10 minutes)

## Variations

### Beginner (3-3-3-3)
If 4 seconds is too long:
- Inhale 3 seconds
- Hold 3 seconds
- Exhale 3 seconds
- Hold 3 seconds

### Advanced (5-5-5-5 or 6-6-6-6)
As you practice, you can extend:
- Longer holds = deeper relaxation
- Don't strain — it should feel natural

### Extended exhale variation
For deeper relaxation:
- Inhale 4 seconds
- Hold 4 seconds
- Exhale 6 seconds
- Hold 4 seconds

Longer exhale = stronger parasympathetic activation.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Rushing
The counts should be slow, even seconds.

Most people rush when stressed. Slow down.

### 2. Shallow breathing
Fill your lungs completely. Use your diaphragm.

Belly should expand, not just chest.

### 3. Tensing during holds
Holding breath ≠ tensing body.

Stay relaxed during holds.

### 4. Giving up too early
First 2-3 cycles might not feel different.

The shift happens around cycle 4-6.

### 5. Only using when desperate
Practice when calm so it's automatic when you're not.

## Box Breathing vs Other Techniques

### Box Breathing vs 4-7-8
- Box: Equal parts, good for any stress
- 4-7-8: Longer exhale, better for sleep

### Box Breathing vs Physiological Sigh
- Box: Takes 1-4 minutes, deeper relaxation
- Physiological sigh: Takes 30 seconds, faster relief

### Box Breathing vs Diaphragmatic Breathing
- Box: Structured, good for acute stress
- Diaphragmatic: Continuous, good for chronic stress

## Using an App

Apps help with:
- Visual guides (following a box/circle)
- Audio cues (so you don't count)
- Timing accuracy
- Progress tracking

[BreathingExercises](/apps/breathingexercises) has a dedicated box breathing mode with visual guide.

## The Navy SEAL Connection

Mark Divine, former Navy SEAL commander, popularized box breathing for stress resilience.

SEALs use it:
- Before missions
- During high-stress operations
- For recovery

If it works in combat, your work deadline is manageable.

## Building a Practice

### Week 1:
2 minutes box breathing after waking.

### Week 2:
Add 2 minutes before a stressful situation (meeting, call, etc.).

### Week 3+:
Practice whenever you notice stress.

Eventually, you won't need to count. It becomes automatic.
