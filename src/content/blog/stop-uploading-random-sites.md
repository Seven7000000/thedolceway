You need to convert a HEIC to JPG.

So you Google "HEIC to JPG converter."

You upload your photo to some random website. It converts. You download.

What happened to your photo in between?

## The Problem No One Thinks About

When you upload a file to an online converter, you're:

1. Sending your file to a stranger's server
2. Trusting they'll delete it after
3. Trusting they won't store it
4. Trusting they won't use it for training AI
5. Trusting their servers are secure

Do you actually trust that?

## What These Sites Actually Do

### Best case scenario
They convert your file and delete it immediately.

Some legitimate services do this.

### Common scenario
They convert your file and keep it for "24 hours" (or longer).

During that time, anyone with the URL might access it. It's sitting on a server you don't control.

### Worst case scenario
They store everything. Use it for analytics. Sell it. Train ML models on it. Get hacked.

You have no idea which scenario you're in.

## The Privacy Disaster

Imagine uploading:
- Your passport
- Financial documents
- Private photos
- Legal contracts
- Medical records

To a random website. With no guarantee of what happens next.

That's what you're doing every time you use a free online converter.

## The Alternative: Local Conversion

Your phone has enough power to convert files locally.

No upload. No server. No trust required.

The file never leaves your device.

## What Can Be Done Locally

Almost everything:

- **Image formats:** HEIC, JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **PDFs:** Create, split, merge, compress
- **Documents:** Basic format conversions
- **Compression:** Reduce file sizes without quality loss

None of this needs a server. Your phone can handle it.

## The App

I built [ConvertApps](/apps/convertapps) because I was tired of uploading personal files to sketchy websites.

100% offline conversion. HEIC to JPG. Images to PDF. PDF to images. Compression.

Your files never leave your phone. Privacy by design.

Also built [Convertly](/apps/convertly) for unit conversions — different kind of conversion, same privacy-first philosophy.

## The Simple Rule

If a conversion can be done locally, do it locally.

There's no reason to involve a third party in converting your images.

Stop trusting strangers with your files.
