You need to convert a file.

HEIC to JPG. PDF to PNG. Word to PDF.

You Google "free file converter." Click the first result. Upload your file. Wait. Download the converted version.

Done, right?

Wrong.

## What happens to your file

That "free" converter isn't a charity. They're a business. And their business model is your data.

When you upload a file:
- It's stored on their servers (for how long? who knows)
- It might be analyzed for advertising purposes
- It could be sold to data brokers
- It's definitely not private anymore

That personal photo? That sensitive document? Now it exists on someone else's server.

"But they say they delete files after 24 hours."

You trust that?

## The files that should never be uploaded

- Personal photos
- Financial documents
- Work files with confidential info
- Contracts and legal documents
- Anything you wouldn't post publicly

Which is basically... most files you'd want to convert.

## The solution: convert locally

Your phone is powerful enough to convert files without the internet.

No uploading. No external servers. No privacy risk.

The file goes in. The converted file comes out. Nothing leaves your device.

## Why I built ConvertApps

[ConvertApps](/apps/convertapps) converts files 100% on your device:

- **Images:** HEIC, JPG, PNG, WebP
- **Documents:** PDF creation and conversion
- **Batch processing:** Convert multiple files at once
- **Zero upload:** Everything happens locally

No accounts. No cloud. No "we might keep your files."

Your files stay your files.

Privacy isn't a feature. It's the architecture.
