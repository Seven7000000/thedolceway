"8 glasses a day." You've heard it a million times. It's also wrong.

That advice is from the 1940s. One-size-fits-all for a 120lb woman and a 220lb man? Come on.

Here's how to actually calculate your daily water intake.

## The Simple Formula

**Your weight (lbs) ÷ 2 = ounces of water per day**

That's it. A 160lb person needs roughly 80oz (about 2.4 liters).

In kilograms: **Your weight (kg) × 30-35 = ml per day**

## But Wait — It's Not That Simple

That's your baseline. You need to adjust for:

### Activity Level
- Light exercise: Add 12oz (350ml)
- Moderate exercise: Add 20oz (600ml)
- Intense workout: Add 32oz+ (1L+)

### Climate
- Hot weather: Add 16-32oz (500ml-1L)
- Dry/air-conditioned environments: Add 8-16oz (250-500ml)

### Other Factors
- Coffee/alcohol: Add 8oz for every caffeinated or alcoholic drink
- Pregnancy: Add 10-12oz (300-350ml)
- Breastfeeding: Add 32oz+ (1L+)

## The Real-World Calculation

Let's say you're:
- 170lbs (77kg)
- Work out 3-4 times a week
- Drink 2 coffees a day
- Live in a moderate climate

**Baseline:** 170 ÷ 2 = 85oz
**Exercise adjustment:** +16oz (average)
**Coffee adjustment:** +16oz
**Total:** ~117oz (3.5L)

That's way more than "8 glasses."

## Signs You're Not Drinking Enough

Your body tells you. Listen:

- Dark yellow urine (should be light yellow)
- Headaches (especially afternoon)
- Fatigue that coffee doesn't fix
- Dry skin, chapped lips
- Feeling hungry when you just ate (thirst mimics hunger)

## Signs You're Drinking Too Much

Yes, this is possible:

- Clear, completely colorless urine
- Bathroom trips every 30 minutes
- Bloating
- Nausea

## The Best Way to Track

Calculating is one thing. Actually drinking enough? Different problem.

Most people forget. Get busy. Skip lunch water. Then chug a liter at 10pm (hello, midnight bathroom trips).

You need:
1. A baseline calculation
2. Reminders that adapt to your schedule
3. Easy tracking (one tap, not 6 steps)

That's why I built [WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop). It calculates your needs, reminds you at the right times, and tracks with one tap.

No math. No guessing. Just drink your water.

## FAQ

**How much water should I drink to lose weight?**
Same formula, but prioritize drinking water before meals. Studies show 16oz (500ml) before eating reduces calorie intake by 75-90 calories per meal.

**Does coffee count toward water intake?**
Partially. Coffee is a mild diuretic, so you absorb about 60-70% of the water. Count it as half.

**Can I drink too much water?**
Yes. Hyponatremia (water intoxication) is real but rare. Stick to your calculated amount spread throughout the day.

**What about sparkling water?**
Counts the same as regular water. The carbonation doesn't affect hydration.
