## What to Look for as a Beginner

### ✅ Must have:
- **Previous weights visible** — Know what you lifted last time
- **Rest timer** — Don't scroll phone between sets
- **Search-friendly exercise library** — Find "bench press" even if you search "chest push thing"

### ❌ Don't need yet:
- Periodization features
- RPE tracking
- One-rep max calculators
- Advanced statistics

### 🚫 Red flags:
- Requires subscription for basic logging
- Can't see previous weights easily
- No rest timer
- Confusing navigation

## How to Use a Gym Tracker (Beginner Guide)

### At the gym:

1. Open app
2. Start workout
3. Select exercise
4. Log weight + reps for each set
5. Rest timer counts down
6. Repeat
7. End workout

### After a few weeks:

Look at your history. You should see:
- Weights increasing (even slightly)
- More reps at same weight
- Better consistency

If not, something's wrong with training or nutrition.

## The "I Don't Know What to Do" Problem

Most beginners don't need a tracker. They need a program.

**Option 1:** Use GymCoachAI — It gives you the workout AND tracks it.

**Option 2:** Follow a beginner program:
- **Reddit PPL** — Free, proven, google it
- **Stronglifts 5x5** — Simple, effective
- **GZCLP** — Slightly more complex, excellent results

Then use any tracker to log it.

## Free vs Paid: Is Premium Worth It?

**Free is enough if you:**
- Just want to log weights
- Don't need fancy charts
- Are okay with limited templates

**Consider paid if you:**
- Want unlimited routines
- Need Apple Watch integration
- Use the app daily for months

For beginners: Start free. Upgrade later if you stick with it.
