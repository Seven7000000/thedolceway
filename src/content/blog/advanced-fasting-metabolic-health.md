You've been fasting for a while.

16:8 is easy now. You barely notice the hunger. You've lost some weight. You feel better.

But you've plateaued. The easy gains are gone. You want to optimize.

Welcome to advanced fasting.

## Beyond the timer

Basic fasting is simple: don't eat for X hours.

Advanced fasting asks deeper questions:

- Is my body actually ready for another fast?
- What am I eating in my window, and how does it affect my next fast?
- Which fasting protocols work best for my goals?
- Am I in ketosis? Fat-burning mode? Autophagy?

You can't answer these questions with a simple timer.

## Metabolic readiness

Your body isn't always in the same state before a fast.

Factors that affect your fasting response:
- What you ate yesterday
- How much sleep you got
- Your stress levels
- Recent exercise
- Previous fasting patterns

Starting a fast when your body is primed for it produces different results than starting when you're depleted.

## Fasting zones

A 16-hour fast isn't one continuous state. You move through zones:

**Hours 0-4:** Post-meal. Digesting. Blood sugar elevated.
**Hours 4-8:** Transition. Glucose depleting. Starting to tap stored energy.
**Hours 8-16:** Fat-burning. Ketone production increasing.
**Hours 16-24:** Deep fasting. Autophagy increasing.
**Hours 24+:** Extended fasting. (Consult a doctor before going here.)

Knowing where you are helps you understand what's happening in your body.

## What you eat matters

Your eating window isn't separate from your fast. It sets up your next fast.

A meal heavy in refined carbs spikes blood sugar and insulin, making your next fast harder.

A meal with protein, healthy fats, and fiber creates stable energy and easier entry into the fasted state.

The fasting app and the nutrition app should talk to each other.

## Why I built Health Intelligence

[Health Intelligence](/apps/healthintelligence) is for fasters who want to go deeper:

- **Metabolic readiness scores** — know if you're primed to fast
- **Fasting zone tracking** — see which metabolic state you're in
- **Meal logging** — connect what you eat to how you fast
- **Smart recommendations** — data-driven suggestions for optimization

It's not replacing your basic fasting timer. It's adding intelligence to it.

You've proven you can fast. Now optimize it.
