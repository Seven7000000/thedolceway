You booked a trip for March.

March feels far away. Vague. Abstract. "Someday."

So you don't prepare. You don't get excited. You don't do the things you should do before you go.

Then suddenly it's March and you're scrambling.

## The problem with dates

Dates are abstract. "March 15th" doesn't feel like anything.

Numbers are concrete. "47 days" hits different.

47 days. That's real. That's urgent. That's countable.

## Countdowns create urgency

When you see a number ticking down, your brain engages differently.

The trip isn't "someday." It's 47 days. Tomorrow it will be 46. The countdown is relentless.

This urgency is useful:

- **For goals:** "90 days until the marathon" keeps you training
- **For deadlines:** "14 days until launch" keeps you shipping
- **For events:** "30 days until the wedding" keeps you preparing
- **For anticipation:** "12 days until vacation" builds excitement

The countdown makes abstract future things feel present.

## Why I built Countdown

[Countdown](/apps/countdown) makes time visible:

- **Beautiful countdown widgets** — see days remaining at a glance
- **Multiple events** — track everything that matters
- **Custom backgrounds** — make each countdown feel unique
- **Milestone notifications** — "30 days left!" "One week left!" "Tomorrow!"

Put your important dates where you can see them.

Watch the numbers tick down.

Feel the urgency. Use the urgency.

Time passes whether you're paying attention or not.

Might as well pay attention.
