## When to Use What

### Use YouTube if:
- You have Premium already
- You want specific/unique sounds
- You're exploring what you like
- You're using it on a computer

### Use a dedicated app if:
- You want offline capability
- You use it for sleep (needs timer)
- You want to mix sounds
- Battery life matters

### Use built-in sounds if:
- You want simple, free, no extra apps
- Basic sounds are enough
- You're already in Apple/Windows ecosystem

## The Sleep Use Case

For sleep specifically, YouTube is problematic:
1. Screen stays on → blue light
2. Ads might play → wake you up
3. Video ends → silence wakes you
4. Battery drain → phone dies

Dedicated apps solve all of this:
- Black screen
- No ads
- Seamless looping
- Timer to stop
- Low battery use

**Verdict:** For sleep, use an app.

## The Focus Use Case

For work/study background noise:
- YouTube is fine (on a computer)
- Apps work on phone
- Built-in sounds are convenient

**Verdict:** Use whatever's easiest.

## Sound Types Explained

**White noise:** Equal intensity across frequencies. Classic "shhhh" sound.

**Pink noise:** Deeper than white noise. Like a waterfall.

**Brown noise:** Even deeper. Like thunder or wind.

**Nature sounds:** Rain, ocean, forest. Varied, naturalistic.

**Lo-fi beats:** Music + ambient sound. Good for focus.

## My Recommendation

**For sleep:** [WhiteNoise](/apps/whitenoise) (free, designed for sleep)

**For work focus:** YouTube or Noisli

**For simplicity:** iPhone built-in background sounds

**For premium experience:** Dark Noise ($10 one-time)
