You sit down to work.

Three hours later, you've accomplished 20 minutes of actual output and spent the rest bouncing between email, Slack, Twitter, and whatever else your brain could find to avoid the hard thing.

Sound familiar?

The Pomodoro Technique fixes this. Here's how.

## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

It's stupid simple:

1. Pick a task
2. Set a timer for 25 minutes
3. Work until the timer rings (no distractions)
4. Take a 5-minute break
5. Repeat

After four Pomodoros, take a longer 15-30 minute break.

That's it. That's the whole system.

## Why it works

Your brain is bad at sustained focus. Evolution didn't design you to stare at spreadsheets for 8 hours. It designed you to scan the savanna for threats.

The Pomodoro Technique works with your biology, not against it:

- **25 minutes is achievable.** Your brain can commit to 25 minutes. It cannot commit to "until it's done."
- **Breaks prevent burnout.** Short, regular breaks keep you fresh. Marathon sessions don't.
- **The timer creates urgency.** When you know you only have 25 minutes, you focus differently.
- **It's measurable.** "I did 8 Pomodoros today" is concrete. "I worked hard" is vague.

## How to actually do it

### Step 1: Eliminate distractions BEFORE you start

Close email. Close Slack. Put your phone in another room. Block distracting websites.

If you have to resist temptation during your Pomodoro, you've already lost. Remove the temptation entirely.

### Step 2: Commit to ONE task

Not "work on the project." One specific task. "Write the introduction" or "Review the first three sections."

Vague tasks invite procrastination. Specific tasks get done.

### Step 3: Start the timer and work

No negotiating. No "just checking one thing." The timer is running. You work.

If something pops into your head ("I should email Bob"), write it on a piece of paper. Don't act on it. Back to work.

### Step 4: Stop when the timer rings

Even if you're in the middle of something. Stop.

This feels wrong at first. But it builds a crucial habit: you do what the timer says. This makes starting the next Pomodoro easier because you know you'll get a break.

### Step 5: Take a real break

Stand up. Walk around. Look out a window. Don't check email — that's not a break.

5 minutes of actual rest makes the next 25 minutes more productive.

## Common mistakes

**Mistake: Skipping breaks to "stay in flow"**
You'll burn out by 2pm. Take the breaks.

**Mistake: Checking "just one notification"**
One notification becomes ten. Full focus or no focus.

**Mistake: Setting unrealistic daily goals**
8 Pomodoros is a solid day. 16 is fantasy. Start with 4 and build up.

**Mistake: Using a phone timer**
Your phone is a distraction machine. Use a dedicated timer or app.

## The bigger picture

The Pomodoro Technique isn't just about productivity. It's about retraining your attention span.

Most people have destroyed their ability to focus through years of constant distraction. Your brain expects stimulation every few seconds. It revolts against sustained attention.

Pomodoros are attention training. You're teaching your brain that it can, in fact, focus for 25 minutes without dying.

After a few weeks, you'll notice something: focusing gets easier. The resistance fades. You start looking forward to deep work instead of dreading it.

## Tools

You can use any timer. Kitchen timer. Phone timer. Browser extension.

But if you want something designed specifically for this — beautiful, minimal, and built to keep you focused — I made [FocusTimer](/apps/focustimer) for exactly this purpose.

No gamification. No social features. Just a timer that helps you do your best work.

Now stop reading and go do a Pomodoro.
