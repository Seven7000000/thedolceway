I watched my dad photograph a document, email it as a JPG, and wonder why it looked terrible.

"My phone camera is great," he said. "Why does this look so bad?"

Because a photo isn't a scan.

## The Difference

### A photo:
- Captures whatever's in frame
- Includes perspective distortion
- Has uneven lighting
- Results in huge file sizes
- Creates an image, not a document

### A proper scan:
- Detects document edges
- Corrects perspective automatically
- Evens out lighting
- Optimizes file size
- Creates a proper PDF

You have a powerful computer in your pocket. Use software that uses it properly.

## What Good Scanner Apps Do

### Auto edge detection
Point at a document. The app detects its edges. No manual cropping.

If you're adjusting corners manually every time, your app sucks.

### Perspective correction
Document at an angle? Good apps flatten it automatically. The result looks like it went through a flatbed scanner.

### Enhancement
Removes shadows. Balances lighting. Whitens paper. Sharpens text.

Bad lighting in the room doesn't matter when software compensates.

### OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
The text in your scan becomes actual text you can search and copy.

Scan a receipt. Search "coffee" six months later. Find it.

### PDF output
Documents should be PDFs. Not JPGs. PDFs are universal, compact, and preservable.

## How to Get Good Scans

### 1. Good lighting helps
Even though apps compensate, starting with decent lighting makes everything better.

Natural light is best. Avoid shadows falling across the document.

### 2. Steady hand
Move too fast and blur ruins everything. Hold still for a second while the app captures.

### 3. Fill the frame
Get close enough that the document fills most of the screen. More pixels on the document = sharper text.

### 4. Avoid glare
Glossy documents under bright lights create white spots that can't be fixed. Angle to avoid direct reflections.

### 5. Let the app work
Don't manually override edge detection unless it's actually wrong. Trust the software — it's usually right.

## The Upgrades Nobody Uses

### Multi-page documents
Scan all pages. Combine into one PDF. Most people don't realize their scanner app does this.

### Batch mode
Some apps let you scan page after page continuously. Way faster than individual captures.

### Cloud sync
Scans can auto-upload to iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Never lose a document.

### OCR search
Your scanned documents become searchable. This alone is worth using a real scanner app.

## The App

I built [ScanSnap](/apps/scansnap) because existing scanner apps either had too many features or too many ads.

AI edge detection. Automatic perspective correction. OCR for handwriting. One-tap to scan.

Your phone is a scanner. Treat it like one.
