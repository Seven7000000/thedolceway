Your textbook is open. Your phone is face-down.

45 seconds later you're watching TikToks.

Sound familiar? Here are apps that actually help.

## The Student Focus Problem

The average student checks their phone 150 times a day. That's once every 6 minutes during waking hours.

Every interruption costs 23 minutes to fully refocus. Do the math.

You're not dumb. You're not lazy. You're fighting against billion-dollar companies designed to steal your attention.

Use tools to fight back.

## Study Session Blueprint

Here's how to actually use these apps:

### Before Studying
1. Put phone in another room (or use blocker)
2. Start your timer app
3. Have ONE task defined (not "study" but "finish chapter 3")

### During Studying
4. Focus until timer ends
5. No phone checks (tree is growing)
6. If interrupted, restart timer

### Breaks
7. 5-10 minute break
8. Walk away from desk
9. Don't check phone (this is the trap)
10. Return and start new session

### After Studying
11. Log total time
12. Review what you accomplished
13. Plan tomorrow's session

## The Honest Truth

Apps help, but they can't study for you.

The student who puts their phone in another room and uses a kitchen timer will out-study the student with 5 concentration apps who keeps making exceptions.

Tools are supplements, not solutions.

**The best strategy:**
1. Phone in another room
2. Website blocker on computer
3. Simple timer
4. Defined tasks
5. Scheduled breaks

That's it. Everything else is optimization.
