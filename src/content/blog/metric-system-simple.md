"He's 185cm tall."

How tall is that?

If you're American, your brain just went blank.

Here's the cheat sheet you never knew you needed.

## Height (cm → feet)

### The quick mental math:
Take the cm number, divide by 30, and that's roughly feet.

Or just memorize these:
- **150cm** = 4'11" (short)
- **160cm** = 5'3" (below average)
- **170cm** = 5'7" (average woman)
- **175cm** = 5'9" (average)
- **180cm** = 5'11" (tall)
- **185cm** = 6'1" (very tall)
- **190cm** = 6'3" (basketball player)

**The Anchors:**
- 180cm ≈ 6 feet
- Every 2.5cm ≈ 1 inch

## Weight (kg → lbs)

### The quick mental math:
Double the kg and add 10%.

75kg → 150 + 15 = 165 lbs

Close enough.

### Common conversions:
- **50kg** = 110 lbs
- **60kg** = 132 lbs
- **70kg** = 154 lbs
- **80kg** = 176 lbs
- **90kg** = 198 lbs
- **100kg** = 220 lbs

**The Anchor:**
- 1kg = 2.2 lbs

## Temperature (°C → °F)

### The quick mental math:
Double it and add 30.

20°C → 40 + 30 = 70°F

Not exact, but ballpark.

### Common conversions:
- **0°C** = 32°F (freezing)
- **10°C** = 50°F (cold)
- **20°C** = 68°F (nice)
- **25°C** = 77°F (warm)
- **30°C** = 86°F (hot)
- **37°C** = 98.6°F (body temp)
- **40°C** = 104°F (very hot)

**The Anchors:**
- 0°C = Freezing
- 20°C = Room temperature
- 30°C = Hot summer day

## Distance (km → miles)

### The quick mental math:
Multiply km by 0.6.

10km × 0.6 = 6 miles

Or remember: 5km ≈ 3 miles (a common race distance).

### Common conversions:
- **1km** = 0.62 miles
- **5km** = 3.1 miles (5K race)
- **10km** = 6.2 miles
- **21km** = 13.1 miles (half marathon)
- **42km** = 26.2 miles (marathon)
- **100km** = 62 miles

## Volume (liters → gallons/cups)

### The quick mental math:
1 liter ≈ 4 cups
4 liters ≈ 1 gallon

### Common conversions:
- **250ml** = 1 cup
- **500ml** = 2 cups (a pint, roughly)
- **1L** = 4 cups
- **2L** = Half gallon
- **4L** = 1 gallon

## Cooking

This is where it actually matters:

- **250ml** = 1 cup
- **15ml** = 1 tablespoon
- **5ml** = 1 teaspoon
- **225g** = 1 cup flour (roughly)
- **200g** = 1 cup sugar (roughly)

Baking by weight (grams) is actually more accurate. Welcome to the metric side.

## The Tool

I built [Convertly](/apps/convertly) for quick conversions on the go.

Because nobody should have to Google "75kg in pounds" ever again.
