Meditation sounds intimidating.

Empty your mind. Sit for an hour. Become enlightened.

Here's the truth: Meditation is just sitting and breathing while someone talks you through it.

That's it. Let's start.

## What Is Guided Meditation?

Regular meditation: You sit in silence and try not to think.
Guided meditation: Someone's voice leads you through the process.

Guided is way easier for beginners. You don't have to figure out what to do — just follow instructions.

## Your First 5-Minute Meditation

Try this right now. Seriously.

1. **Sit somewhere comfortable** (chair, couch, floor — doesn't matter)
2. **Close your eyes** (or soften your gaze)
3. **Breathe normally** for 3 breaths
4. **Notice your body** — feel your weight in the chair, feet on floor
5. **Focus on your breath** — just notice it, don't change it
6. **When thoughts come** — notice them, let them go, return to breath
7. **Continue for 5 minutes** — set a gentle timer

That's meditation. You just did it.

## Why Guided Is Better for Beginners

### You don't have to think
The guide tells you exactly what to do. No decisions.

### You stay on track
Without guidance, your 5-minute meditation becomes 5 minutes of planning your week. The voice anchors you.

### You learn techniques
Good guides teach breathing, body scans, visualizations. You pick up skills.

### It's less boring
Listening to something is more engaging than silence.

## Types of Guided Meditation

### 1. Breath Focus
The guide brings your attention to your breathing. You notice inhales, exhales, pauses. Simple, foundational.

**Best for:** Total beginners, anxiety, stress relief

### 2. Body Scan
The guide walks you through your body, part by part, helping you notice sensations and release tension.

**Best for:** Relaxation, sleep, physical tension

### 3. Visualization
The guide describes a scene — a beach, forest, mountain. You imagine being there.

**Best for:** Relaxation, creativity, escape from stress

### 4. Loving-Kindness
The guide helps you cultivate feelings of warmth toward yourself and others.

**Best for:** Self-criticism, relationship issues, emotional healing

### 5. Noting/Labeling
The guide teaches you to "note" thoughts and feelings ("thinking," "planning," "worrying") without engaging.

**Best for:** Busy minds, building mindfulness skills

## How to Choose Your First Meditation

**If you're stressed:** Breath focus or body scan
**If you can't sleep:** Body scan or visualization
**If your mind races:** Noting/labeling
**If you're harsh on yourself:** Loving-kindness
**If you want to relax:** Visualization

Start with 5 minutes. Not 10. Not 20. Five.

## Where to Find Guided Meditations

### Apps
- **[MeditationApp](/apps/meditationapp)** — Clean, beginner-friendly, free (I built this)
- **Headspace** — Great for beginners, subscription required
- **Calm** — Nice sleep content, subscription required
- **Insight Timer** — Huge free library, variable quality

### YouTube
Thousands of free meditations. Quality varies wildly. Search "[duration] [type] guided meditation" (e.g., "5 minute breath focus guided meditation").

### Podcasts
"Meditation Oasis" and "The Daily Meditation Podcast" have free guided sessions.

## The Common Obstacles

### "I can't empty my mind"
You're not supposed to. The goal isn't to stop thinking — it's to notice when you're thinking and return to the breath. Thoughts are normal.

### "I don't have time"
You have 5 minutes. Before bed. While waiting. Morning coffee. Start there.

### "I can't sit still"
Try walking meditation or body scan while lying down. Movement and stillness are both valid.

### "Nothing happens"
Meditation isn't about having experiences. It's about practice. The benefits come from consistency, not individual sessions.

### "I fall asleep"
Try meditating earlier in the day, sitting up, or opening your eyes slightly.

## A Simple Beginner Schedule

**Week 1:** 5 minutes daily (guided breath focus)
**Week 2:** 5 minutes daily (try body scan)
**Week 3:** 7 minutes daily (alternate between favorites)
**Week 4:** 10 minutes daily

After a month, you'll have the basics. Then adjust based on what works.

## What to Expect

**Day 1:** Feels weird. Mind wanders constantly. "Am I doing this right?"

**Week 1:** Still feels weird. But you notice you're calmer after sessions.

**Week 2:** Starting to look forward to it. Sessions feel shorter.

**Week 4:** Noticing benefits during the day — more patience, less reactivity.

**Month 2+:** A habit. You feel off when you skip it.

## FAQ

**How long should a beginner meditate?**
Start with 5 minutes. Build to 10-20 over time. More isn't always better.

**Do I need to sit cross-legged?**
No. Sit however you're comfortable. Chair, couch, floor. Lying down is fine too.

**Can I meditate with eyes open?**
Yes. Soft gaze, unfocused, looking slightly down. Some people prefer this.

**When's the best time to meditate?**
Morning is popular (start the day centered). But any consistent time works.

**What if I miss a day?**
Start again tomorrow. No guilt.

**Is this religious?**
Meditation comes from Buddhist traditions, but modern guided meditation is secular. No beliefs required.
