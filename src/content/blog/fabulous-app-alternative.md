Fabulous is beautiful. It's also $100/year.

For a routine app.

Here are alternatives that won't drain your wallet.

## What Fabulous Does

Fabulous is a "habit coaching" app focused on building routines.

**The approach:**
- Start with ONE habit
- "Journeys" gradually add more
- Science-based methodology
- Beautiful design
- Daily coaching content

**The cost:** $100/year (after free trial)

## Why People Love Fabulous

- **Guided approach** — Tells you exactly what to do
- **Doesn't overwhelm** — Adds habits slowly
- **Great design** — Genuinely beautiful
- **Science-backed** — Research-based methodology
- **Coaching content** — Explains WHY you're doing things

## Why People Leave Fabulous

- **Expensive** — $100/year is steep
- **Slow progression** — Sometimes frustratingly slow
- **Content heavy** — Lots of reading/watching before doing
- **Locked features** — Free version is basically a demo
- **Subscription model** — Can't buy outright

## The Alternatives

### Free: SimpleStreaks + MeditationApp + Affirmations

Why buy a routine app when you can build one?

**The stack:**

**What you lose:**

## Who Should Pay for Fabulous?

**Pay for Fabulous if:**
- You've tried free apps and failed
- You need hand-holding through routine building
- You value guided journeys
- $100/year is easily affordable
- You respond well to coaching/education

**Don't pay for Fabulous if:**
- You know how to build routines
- You just need tracking
- Budget is a concern
- You've had success with simpler apps
- You skip the coaching content anyway

## Building a Fabulous-Style Routine for Free

Week 1-2: ONE habit
- Pick your most important morning habit
- Just do that one thing consistently
- Track with SimpleStreaks

Week 3-4: Add another
- Once habit #1 is easy, add #2
- Stack it immediately after #1

Week 5-6: Add a third
- Keep building the chain
- Each habit triggers the next

Week 7+: Refine
- Adjust timing
- Remove what doesn't work
- Add what's missing

This is basically what Fabulous does. You just don't have an app telling you.

## The Coaching Content Question

The main thing free apps lack: Fabulous's coaching content.

**What you're missing:**
- Explanations of habit science
- Motivational content
- Guided meditation/breathing
- The "journey" narrative

**Where to get it free:**
- YouTube: "habit science" videos
- Books: "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
- Podcasts: Huberman Lab
- Free apps: Insight Timer has educational content

The information is available. You're paying Fabulous to package it nicely.

## My Recommendation

**Start with:** SimpleStreaks (free)

Track your morning routine. Add habits one at a time. See if that works.

**If you need timed guidance:** Routinery ($40/year)

Walks you through routines step by step. Good value.

**If you need gentle motivation:** Finch (free)

Less aggressive than other trackers. Self-compassion focused.

**If you really want Fabulous:** Try the free trial first

Make sure you actually use the coaching content. If you skip it, you're overpaying.

## FAQ

**Is Fabulous worth $100/year?**
For some people, yes. If you use the coaching and journeys, it's valuable. If you just track habits, it's overpriced.

**What's the best free Fabulous alternative?**
SimpleStreaks for tracking. Finch for gentle approach. Stack multiple free apps.

**Can I cancel Fabulous after building my routine?**
Yes, but your journey progress and some features will be lost.

**Why is Fabulous so expensive?**
They position as "coaching," not just an app. You're paying for content + methodology.
