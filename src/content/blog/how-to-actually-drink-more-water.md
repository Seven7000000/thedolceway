You know you should drink more water.

You've known this for years. Doctors say it. Fitness influencers say it. Your mom says it.

And yet, it's 4pm and you've had two cups of coffee and nothing else.

Let's fix that.

## Why you're failing

The usual advice is useless:

- "Carry a water bottle everywhere" — You do. It sits on your desk, empty.
- "Drink a glass when you wake up" — You forget by the time you're done scrolling.
- "Set reminders" — You ignore them within three days.

The problem isn't knowledge. You know water is good. The problem is friction and habit formation.

## What actually works

### 1. Tie it to existing habits

Don't add "drink water" as a new task. Attach it to something you already do.

- Before every meal → drink a glass
- Every time you go to the bathroom → refill and drink
- Every time you check your phone → take a sip

This is called habit stacking. You're not building a new habit from scratch — you're piggybacking on existing behavior.

### 2. Make it visible

Your water bottle shouldn't be in your bag. It should be directly in your line of sight.

On your desk. Next to your keyboard. Where you literally cannot ignore it.

Out of sight = out of mind = dehydrated.

### 3. Track streaks, not ounces

Counting exact ounces is tedious. Most people quit within a week.

Instead, track whether you hit a simple daily goal. Yes or no. Did you drink enough today?

Streaks create momentum. Nobody wants to break a 30-day streak. The number itself becomes motivating.

### 4. Smart reminders > dumb reminders

A reminder every 30 minutes is noise. You'll ignore it or turn it off.

Smart reminders work differently:
- They adapt to your schedule
- They know you just logged water and don't bug you
- They get more insistent as the day goes on if you're behind

This is the difference between an annoying alarm and an intelligent nudge.

## The real secret

Consistency beats intensity.

Don't try to drink a gallon on day one. Just drink a bit more than yesterday. Every day.

Small improvements compound. In a month, you won't recognize your hydration habits.

## Build the system

If you want a tool that does all of this — habit stacking triggers, streak tracking, smart reminders — I built [WaterDrop](/apps/waterdrop) for exactly this reason.

It's launching soon. The waitlist is open.

But even without an app, the principles work. Tie water to existing habits. Keep it visible. Track streaks. Make reminders smart.

Your 3pm headache will thank you.
