16:8 is the most popular fasting schedule for a reason.

It's simple. It works. And you're basically already doing a version of it (unless you eat at 2am).

Here's everything you need to know to start.

## What Is 16:8 Fasting?

Fast for 16 hours. Eat during an 8-hour window.

That's it. No calorie counting. No special foods. Just timing.

**Example schedule:**
- Stop eating at 8pm
- Skip breakfast
- First meal at 12pm (noon)
- Last meal by 8pm

You're sleeping through most of the fast. It's easier than it sounds.

## Why 16:8 Works

### 1. Insulin drops
When you fast, insulin levels decrease. Low insulin = your body can access stored fat for energy.

### 2. Growth hormone increases
Fasting boosts HGH, which helps with muscle preservation and fat burning.

### 3. Cellular repair (autophagy)
Your cells start cleaning out damaged components. This kicks in around 12-16 hours.

### 4. Calorie reduction (naturally)
Smaller eating window = fewer opportunities to overeat. Most people eat 300-500 fewer calories without trying.

## How to Start 16:8

### Week 1: The Transition

Don't jump straight into 16 hours. Build up.

**Days 1-3:** 12-hour fast (8pm to 8am)
**Days 4-5:** 14-hour fast (8pm to 10am)
**Days 6-7:** 16-hour fast (8pm to 12pm)

### Week 2: Lock It In

Pick your eating window and stick to it. Consistency matters more than perfection.

**Popular windows:**
- 12pm - 8pm (most common)
- 10am - 6pm (early birds)
- 2pm - 10pm (night owls)

## What Breaks a Fast?

The short answer: calories.

**Won't break your fast:**
- Water
- Black coffee
- Plain tea
- Sparkling water
- Zero-calorie drinks

**Will break your fast:**
- Milk in coffee (yes, even a splash)
- Diet sodas (some say ok, but artificial sweeteners can trigger insulin)
- BCAAs
- Anything with calories

**Gray area:**
- Bulletproof coffee (technically breaks the fast, but some people do this and still see results)
- Sugar-free gum

## Sample 16:8 Schedule

**Morning (fasting):**
- 7am: Wake up
- 7:30am: Black coffee or tea
- 10am: Sparkling water
- 11:30am: Getting hungry (normal, push through)

**Eating window:**
- 12pm: First meal (break-fast) — protein + veggies
- 3pm: Snack if needed
- 7pm: Dinner — balanced meal
- 7:45pm: Small dessert if you want
- 8pm: Eating window closes

**Evening (fasting begins):**
- 9pm: Herbal tea if needed
- Sleep
- Repeat

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Breaking the fast with junk
Your first meal matters. Protein and fiber first. Donuts? Your blood sugar will spike and crash.

### 2. Not eating enough during the window
Some people under-eat and crash. You still need adequate calories — just compressed into 8 hours.

### 3. Obsessing over the exact time
15:45 won't ruin your progress. Relax.

### 4. Drinking your calories
A latte with oat milk is 200+ calories. Save calories for food.

### 5. No tracking
You think you're fasting 16 hours. You're actually doing 14. Track it.

## Tracking Your Fast

You can use a clock. Or your phone's timer.

Or you can use an app that:
- Starts automatically
- Shows your fasting zone (fat burning, autophagy, etc.)
- Sends reminders when your window opens
- Tracks your streak

I built [FastTrack](/apps/fasttrack) for exactly this. One tap to start. Visual timer showing your progress. No guesswork.

## Who Shouldn't Do 16:8

**Talk to a doctor first if you:**
- Are pregnant or breastfeeding
- Have diabetes (especially Type 1)
- Have a history of eating disorders
- Take medications that require food
- Are underweight

**Probably fine but ease in if you:**
- Are new to fasting
- Work out intensely in the morning
- Have blood sugar issues

## FAQ

**Can I workout while fasting?**
Yes. Many people prefer fasted workouts. You might feel weaker at first while adapting.

**Will I lose muscle?**
No, if you eat enough protein during your window (0.7-1g per pound of bodyweight).

**How long until I see results?**
Most people notice something within 2 weeks. Real body composition changes take 4-8 weeks.

**Can I do 16:8 every day?**
Yes. Many people do it 7 days a week. Some take weekends off. Both work.

**What if I get really hungry?**
Drink water. It passes. Hunger comes in waves, not a constant climb.

**Is 16:8 better than 18:6 or 20:4?**
16:8 is the most sustainable for most people. Start here. Adjust later if you want.
