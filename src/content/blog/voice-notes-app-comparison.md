Your best ideas come when you can't type.

## Why Transcription Matters

Recording is easy. Finding that idea from 3 weeks ago? Hard.

Good transcription means:

## Transcription Quality Comparison

I tested each app with the same audio:

| App | Accuracy | Speed | Speaker ID |
|-----|----------|-------|------------|
| Otter.ai | 95% | Real-time | ✅ |
| ThinkFlow | 92% | Fast | ❌ |
| Apple | 90% | Fast | ❌ |
| Just Press Record | 90% | Fast | ❌ |
| Whisper | 95% | Slower | ❌ |

**Otter** and **Whisper** are most accurate. **ThinkFlow** is best balance of accuracy and privacy.

## The Privacy Question

Where does your audio go?

**On-device processing:**
- ThinkFlow ✅
- Just Press Record ✅
- Apple Voice Memos ✅
- Whisper ✅

**Cloud processing:**
