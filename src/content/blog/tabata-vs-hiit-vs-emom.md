"I did HIIT today."

Did you though? Or did you do Tabata? Or circuits? Or just... cardio?

These terms get conflated constantly. Let's sort them out.

## HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)

**What it is:** Any workout alternating between high-intensity bursts and rest/low-intensity periods.

**Format:** Flexible. Could be 30s on, 30s off. Could be 2 minutes on, 1 minute off. Many variations.

**Example:**
- Sprint 30 seconds
- Walk 60 seconds
- Repeat 8-10 times

**Best for:** General fitness, fat loss, time efficiency.

HIIT is the umbrella term. Tabata and EMOM are specific protocols within it.

## Tabata

**What it is:** A very specific HIIT protocol. 20 seconds of maximum effort, 10 seconds rest, 8 rounds. Total: 4 minutes.

**Format:** 20s on, 10s off × 8 = 4 minutes

**Example:**
- 20s air squats (max effort)
- 10s rest
- Repeat 8 times
- Total time: 4 minutes

**Best for:** Time-crunched workouts, finishers, testing mental limits.

**The catch:** True Tabata is BRUTAL. "Maximum effort" means you should feel like dying by round 6. If you can chat, you're not doing Tabata.

## EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)

**What it is:** Perform a set number of reps at the start of every minute. Rest for whatever time remains. New minute, new set.

**Format:** Start of minute = do X reps. Rest until next minute.

**Example:**
- 10-minute EMOM
- Minute 1: 15 kettlebell swings, rest until minute 2
- Minute 2: 15 kettlebell swings, rest until minute 3
- Continue for 10 minutes

**Best for:** Building work capacity, strength endurance, pacing practice.

**The catch:** If your reps take 50 seconds, you only get 10 seconds rest. Pace yourself early.

## The Comparison

| Protocol | Structure | Total Time | Intensity | Rest Control |
|----------|-----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| **HIIT** | Flexible | 15-45 min | High | Fixed |
| **Tabata** | 20s on, 10s off × 8 | 4 min | Maximum | Fixed (short) |
| **EMOM** | Reps per minute | 10-30 min | Moderate-High | Earned |

## When to Use Each

### Use HIIT when:
- You want a solid cardio/conditioning session
- You have 20-40 minutes
- You want flexibility in programming

### Use Tabata when:
- You only have 4 minutes
- You want a workout finisher
- You want to test your mental toughness
- You're ready to push to actual maximum effort

### Use EMOM when:
- You want to practice a specific movement
- You're working on strength endurance
- You want built-in rest that rewards efficiency

## Common Mistakes

**Calling everything "HIIT"**
Walking on the treadmill? Not HIIT. Medium-effort circuits? Not HIIT. If you're not actually pushing high intensity, it's just... cardio.

**Fake Tabata**
Going "pretty hard" for 20 seconds is not Tabata. True Tabata should leave you gasping by round 4. Most people have never done real Tabata.

**Wrong EMOM rep count**
If you pick 25 burpees per minute and each takes 3 seconds, that's 75 seconds of work per 60-second minute. Do the math first.

## The Timer

Whatever protocol you choose, you need a timer that handles intervals properly.

[WorkoutTimer](/apps/workouttimer) has presets for Tabata, custom HIIT intervals, and EMOM formatting.

Set your protocol. Hit start. Focus on the work.
