Forest is clever. Plant a tree, stay focused, tree grows.

But guilt-based gamification isn't for everyone. And sometimes you need something more aggressive.

Here are alternatives.

## Why People Look for Forest Alternatives

1. **Tree death guilt** — Some people find it stressful, not motivating
2. **Doesn't actually block apps** — You CAN leave, you just kill a tree
3. **Gets boring** — Same mechanic, every session, forever
4. **Need harder blocking** — Some people need actual prevention, not guilt
5. **Different platforms** — Forest's web version is limited

## Which Type of Focus App Do You Need?

### Hard app blocking:
→ **Opal** (mobile) or **Cold Turkey** (desktop)

You have no willpower. You need prevention, not guilt.

→ **Flora**

You like the tree thing, just want social features.

### Heavy gamification:
→ **Habitica**
