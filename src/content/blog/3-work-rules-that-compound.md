Work doesn’t compound from hours. It compounds from **leverage**.

Most people try to win by doing more. The people who scale output do it by doing **the right things first**, and turning those actions into systems.

Below are three rules I keep coming back to. They’re simple, but if you apply them consistently, they compound hard.

## 1) Hard things first

Your first 1–2 hours of the day are your highest‑energy window. That’s the only time you should be doing the hardest work.

Not email. Not admin. Not “warming up.”

If you consistently put the hard thing first, everything else becomes easier:
- You ship faster
- Decision fatigue drops
- You build momentum early

**Rule:** If it’s hard, it goes first.

## 2) Systems > tasks

Tasks are one‑off. Systems repeat.

If something takes mental effort more than once, it deserves a system. A checklist, a template, or a workflow you can reuse.

Systems remove friction, and friction kills consistency.

**Rule:** Build the system once, then let it run.

## 3) Document everything

Your future self is your best teammate. But only if you leave notes.

Documenting doesn’t slow you down — it speeds you up:
- You don’t re‑learn the same lessons
- You can delegate faster
- You build a library of decisions

**Rule:** Write it down while it’s fresh.

Leverage isn’t a secret. It’s just discipline, repeated.

Pick one rule from above and run it for a week. You’ll feel the difference.
