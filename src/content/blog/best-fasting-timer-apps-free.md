You don't need to pay for a fasting app.

But you also don't want one that shows ads every time you check your timer.

I tested the most popular free fasting apps. Here's what's actually worth downloading.

## Quick Comparison

| App | Free Tier | Ads | Best Feature | Rating |
|-----|-----------|-----|--------------|--------|
| FastTrack | Full features | No | Clean timer + zones | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Zero | Limited | No | Community | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Fastic | Very limited | Yes | Gamification | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Simple | Limited | Some | Meal suggestions | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Life Fasting | Core features | No | Circles (social) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## The Best Free Options

### 1. FastTrack

**Price:** Free
**Ads:** None

I built this one, so yes, I'm biased. But I built it because the free options were frustrating.

**What you get free:**
- Unlimited fasting timers
- Fasting zones visualization (fat burn, ketosis, autophagy)
- Custom fasting schedules
- Apple Watch app
- Streak tracking
- Apple Health sync

**What it does right:**
- One tap to start/end
- Clean visual showing exactly where you are in your fast
- No features locked behind paywall
- No ads interrupting your timer

**What could be better:**
- Newer app (fewer reviews)

### 2. Zero

**Price:** Free (Premium $70/year)
**Ads:** None

The most popular fasting app. Made by the guy who coined "bulletproof coffee."

**What you get free:**
- Basic timer
- Limited fasting history
- Limited insights

**What's locked:**
- Fasting zones visualization
- Advanced stats
- Coach feature
- Most useful insights

**Verdict:** Good, but the best stuff is paywalled. $70/year is steep.

### 3. Life Fasting Tracker

**Price:** Free (Premium available)
**Ads:** None

Best known for "Circles" — group fasting with friends.

**What you get free:**
- Fasting timer
- Basic stats
- Circles (social fasting)
- Some zone tracking

**What's locked:**
- Advanced insights
- Detailed analytics

**Verdict:** Great if you want to fast with friends. Otherwise, basic.

### 4. Fastic

**Price:** Free (Premium $12/month)
**Ads:** Yes

Very gamified. Quests, achievements, challenges.

**What you get free:**
- Basic timer
- Some gamification elements
- Recipes

**What's locked:**
- Detailed fasting tracking
- Meal plans
- Most features

**What's annoying:**
- Constant upsells
- Premium prompts every session
- Ads

**Verdict:** Fun if you like gamification. Aggressive monetization.

### 5. Simple: Intermittent Fasting

**Price:** Free trial, then subscription
**Ads:** Some

Focuses on the "why" — lots of educational content.

**What you get free:**
- Basic timer
- Some tips
- Limited tracking

**What's locked:**
- Full fasting features
- Meal tracking
- Insights

**Verdict:** Basically a trial. Pushes you to subscribe quickly.

## What to Look For in a Free Fasting App

### Must-have features:
1. **Reliable timer** — Sounds obvious, but some apps don't count background time correctly
2. **Start/stop with one tap** — No 4-screen navigation
3. **Fasting zones** — Know when you hit fat burning vs autophagy
4. **History** — See your past fasts

### Nice to have:
- Apple Watch app
- Widget for home screen
- Apple Health sync
- Streak tracking

### Red flags:
- Ads on the timer screen (you'll look at this 10x a day)
- Basic features paywalled
- Subscription required for core functionality
- Constant upsell prompts

## The Hidden Costs of "Free"

Many "free" fasting apps:
- Show ads every time you open them
- Lock basic features after 7 days
- Require subscription for history beyond 1 week
- Push premium constantly

A truly free app should let you track your fast without interruption. That's the minimum.

## Do You Even Need an App?

Honestly? You could use your phone's built-in timer.

But a fasting app:
- Tracks your progress over time
- Shows fasting zones so you know what's happening in your body
- Motivates with streaks
- Reminds you when your window opens/closes

If you're serious about fasting, an app helps. If you're just trying it once, set a timer.

## FAQ

**Which fasting app is completely free?**
FastTrack and Life Fasting offer the most features for free. Zero's free tier is very limited.

**Is Zero worth paying for?**
If you want detailed insights and coaching, maybe. $70/year is expensive for a timer.

**Can I use Apple Health to track fasting?**
Not directly. Apple Health doesn't have a fasting category. You need an app.

**What's the best fasting app for beginners?**
One with clear fasting zones so you understand what's happening. FastTrack or Zero's free tier.

**Do I need the premium version of any fasting app?**
No. Basic fasting tracking doesn't require premium features.
