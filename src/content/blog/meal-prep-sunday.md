Every single day:

"What should we eat?"
"I don't know, what do you want?"
"I don't know, what do we have?"
"I don't know, let's just order something."

Sound familiar?

## The Problem

Decision fatigue about food is real.

When you don't have a plan, you default to:
- Ordering takeout (expensive, often unhealthy)
- Eating random stuff from the fridge
- Skipping meals
- Making the same 3 things on repeat

None of these are ideal.

## The Solution: Meal Prep Sunday

One afternoon. One time. 2 hours.

Answer "what's for dinner?" for the entire week. Cook what needs cooking. Prep what needs prepping.

Then coast through Monday-Friday without thinking about it.

## The System

### Step 1: Plan (20 minutes)

Choose 3-4 dinners for the week.

Not 7. Not 5. Just 3-4.

Why fewer?
- Leftovers cover other nights
- Flexibility for spontaneous plans
- Less variety = less cooking = more realistic

For each meal, note:
- Recipe or instructions
- Ingredients needed

### Step 2: Inventory Check (5 minutes)

What do you already have?

Cross off ingredients you don't need to buy. This saves money and reduces food waste.

### Step 3: Shop (30-45 minutes)

One trip. One list.

Online ordering helps here. You can place the order Friday, have it delivered Saturday or Sunday.

No more midweek "oh we need milk" trips.

### Step 4: Prep (60-90 minutes)

This is the actual meal prep:

**Must do:**
- Wash and chop vegetables
- Marinate proteins
- Cook grains (rice, quinoa) in bulk
- Prepare salad ingredients

**Optional but helpful:**
- Pre-cook proteins
- Make sauces or dressings
- Portion snacks

**Store properly:**
- Clear containers you can see into
- Label if needed
- Maximize fridge visibility

### Step 5: Execute (minimal daily effort)

Each night, assembling takes 15-20 minutes instead of 45.

Vegetables are chopped. Protein is marinated. Grains are cooked.

Dinner happens. Fast.

## Sample Week

| Day | Meal | Prep Status |
|-----|------|-------------|
| Sun | Prep day | Eating out or simple |
| Mon | Sheet pan chicken + veggies | All prepped, just cook |
| Tue | Stir fry with rice | Veggies cut, rice made |
| Wed | Tacos | Protein marinated, toppings ready |
| Thu | Leftovers | Already done |
| Fri | Pizza night | You earned this |
| Sat | Flexible | Finish leftovers or go out |

## Common Mistakes

**Planning too many meals**
3-4 is the sweet spot. More than that and prep becomes overwhelming.

**No recipe access during prep**
Have your recipes pulled up. Know what you're doing before you start.

**Prepping things that don't keep well**
Avocado? Prep day-of. Onions? Done on Sunday, fine all week.

**Not using containers you can see into**
If you can't see the food, you forget it exists. Clear containers prevent waste.
